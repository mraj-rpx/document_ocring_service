Application/Control Number: 10/913,441 Page 2
Art Unit: 2823

The text of those sections of Title 35, US. Code not included in this action can be found

in a prior Ofﬁce action.

Claim 148 is rejected under 35 U.S.C. 102(b) as being anticipated by Ogawa et al (US.
Patent 5,437,894).

The rejection is maintained as stated in the Ofﬁce Action mailed O3 -O9-O6, and as stated
below.

Ogawa et al discloses a bonding method, comprising forming ﬁrst and second materials
having ﬁrst and second bonding surfaces, respectively, etching said ﬁrst and second bonding
surfaces (Column 9, lines 55-65, and Column 31, lines 53-67), bringing into direct contact said
ﬁrst and second bonding surfaces aﬁer said etching step, and forming a chemical bond near room
temperature between said ﬁrst and second bonding surfaces (Column 32, lines 10-63).

Applicant argues Ogawa et al does not teach bringing the ﬁrst and second etched surfaces
into direct contact and then forming a chemical bond between the ﬁrst and second surfaces.
However, the claims are not so limited. Furthermore, and as recited in claim 148, Ogawa et al
discloses bringing the ﬁrst and second surfaces into direct contact after the etching step, and
forming a chemical bond near room temperature between the ﬁrst and second surfaces, as

disclosed in Column 31, lines 53-67, and Column 32, lines 10-63.

Claims 149-151 are rejected under 35 U.S.C. 103(a) as being unpatentable over Ogawa et

al as applied to claim 148 above, and ﬁlrther in View of the follOwing comments.

Application/Control Number: 10/913,441 Page 3
Art Unit: 2823

The rejection is maintained as stated in the Ofﬁce Action mailed 03-09-06, and as stated
above.

Ogawa et al discloses the claimed invention except for forming a bond between said ﬁrst
and second bonding surfaces at room temperature with a strength of at least 500 mJ/mz, 1000
mJ/mz, and 2000 mJ/mz. It would have been obvious to one having ordinary skill in the art at the
time the invention was made to determine a suitable bond strength between the ﬁrst and second
bonding surfaces, since it has been held that where the general conditions of a claim are
disclosed in the prior art, discovering the optimum or workable ranges involves only routine skill
in the art. In re Aller, 105 USPQ 233.

In addition, the selection of a suitable bond strength, it’s obvious because it is a matter of
determining optimum process conditions by routine experimentation with a limited number of
species of result effective variables. These claims are prima facie obvious without showing that
the claimed ranges achieve unexpected results relative to the prior art range. In re Woodruff, 16
USPQ2d 1935, 1937 (Fed. Cir.‘1990). See also In re Huang, 40 USPQ2d 1685, 1688 (Fed. Cir.
1996)(claimed ranges or a result effective variable, which do not overlap the prior art ranges, are
unpatentable unless they produce a new and unexpected result which is different in kind and not
merely in degree from the results of the prior art). See also In re Boesch, 205 USPQ 215
(CCPA) (discovery of optimum value of result effective variable in known process is ordinarily
within skill or art) and In re Aller, 105 USPQ 233 (CCPA 1995) (selection of optimum ranges
within prior art general conditions is obvious).

Note that the speciﬁcation contains no disclosure of either the critical nature of the

claimed bond strengths or any unexpected results arising therefrom. Where patentability is said

Application/Control Number: lO/913,44l Page 4
Art Unit: 2823

to be based upon particular chosen bond strengths or upon another variable recited in a claim, the
Applicant must show that the chosen bond strengths are critical. In re Woodrut, 919 F.2d 1575,

1578, 16 USPQ2d 1934, 1936 (Fed. Cir. 1990).

Claims 152-157 are objected to as being dependent upon a rejected base claim, but would
be allowable if rewritten in independent form including all of the limitations of the base claim

and any intervening claims.
Claims 138—147, and 158-173, are allowed.

THIS ACTION IS MADE FINAL. Applicant is reminded of the extension of time
policy as set forth in 37 CFR l.l36(a). ' A

Ashortened statutory period for reply to this ﬁnal action is set to expire THREE
MONTHS from the mailing date of this action. In the event a ﬁrst reply is ﬁled Within TWO
MONTHS of the mailing date of this ﬁnal action and the advisory action is not mailed until after
the end of the THREE—MONTH shortened statutory period, then the shortened statutory period
will expire on the date the advisory action is mailed, and any extension fee pursuant to 37
CFR l.l36(a) will be calculated from the mailing date of the advisory action. In no event,
however, will the statutory period for reply expire later than SIX MONTHS from the mailing

date of.this ﬁnal action.

Detailed Action
Claim Rejections - 35 USC § 102
1. The following is a quotation of the appropriate paragraphs of 35 U.S.C. 102 that

form the basis for the rejections under this section made in this Office action:

A person shall be entitled to a patent unless —

(e) the invention was described in (1) an application for patent, published under section 122(b), by
another filed in the United States before the invention by the applicant for patent or (2) a patent
granted on an application for patent by another filed in the United States before the invention by the
applicant for patent, except that an international application filed under the treaty defined in section
351 (a) shall have the effects for purposes of this subsection of an application filed in the United States
only if the international application designated the United States and was published under Article 21 (2)
of such treaty in the English language.

Claims 1, 6-12, and 16-20 are rejected under 35 U.S.C. 102(e) as being
anticipated by Yim et al. (cited 2006/0104288).

For claim 1, Yim discloses a method for communication between two or more
endpoints, said method comprising: receiving a plurality of multiport packets of data in a
multiport communication protocol (see paragraph 35, lines 6-8, wherein a plurality of
TCP and UDP connections are received at the firewall); converting said plurality of
multiport packets into a plurality of singIe-port packets in a singIe-port communication
protocol (see paragraph 35, lines 6-8, wherein the plurality of TCP and UDP
connections are tunneled into a single TCP connection), wherein said singIe-port
communication protocol is not hypertext transport protocol (HTTP) (see paragraph 45,
lines 13-17, wherein the protocol is telnet); transmitting said plurality of singIe-port
packets over a commonIy-open port (see paragraph 35, line 8, wherein the single TCP

connection is transmitted through open port 80 and see paragraph 45, lines 13-17,

Application/Control Number: 11/403,549 Page 3
Art Unit: 2419

wherein the port may be 23 for teInet) to one or more endpoints traversing one or more
firewalls (see paragraph 35, lines 4-5, open port 80 is used to traverse a firewall and
see paragraph 45, lines 13-17, wherein the port may be 23 for teInet) using said
commonIy-open port; receiving said plurality of singIe-port packets at said one or more
endpoints (see paragraph 35, lines 9-12, wherein another H.323 application receives
the TCP connection); reconverting said plurality of singIe-port packets into said multiport
communication protocol (see paragraph 35, lines 9-12, wherein the other H.323
application converts the single TCP connection back to the plurality of TCP and UDP
connections); and delivering said plurality of multiport packets using two or more ports
associated with said multiport communication protocol (see fig. 3, wherein server 128
transmits the multiport packets over a single port through firewall 124 to H.323
application 122, which converts the single port packets back to multiport packets and

delivers them to client 120).

For claim 12, Yim discloses a system (see fig. 3) comprising: a first network
device (120), comprising: an interface for receiving a plurality of packets of data from
two or more ports (see paragraph 35, lines 6-8, wherein a plurality of TCP and UDP
connections are received at the firewall); and a conversion table for said first network
device to convert said plurality of packets into a singIe-port communication protocol (see
paragraph 35, lines 6-8, wherein the plurality of TCP and UDP connections are tunneIed
into a single TCP connection), wherein said singIe-port communication protocol is

acceptable by any of a plurality of different commonIy-open transmission control

Application/Control Number: 11/403,549 Page 4
Art Unit: 2419

protocol (TCP) ports (see paragraph 45, lines 13-17, wherein the port is 80 for HTTP
and 23 for telnet), and wherein said interface communicates said converted plurality of
packets over a selected one of the plurality of different commonIy-open TCP ports (see
paragraph 35, line 8, wherein the single TCP connection is transmitted through open
port 80 and see paragraph 45, lines 13-17, wherein the port may be 23 for telnet); and a
second network device (128) comprising: a second interface for receiving said
converted plurality of packets from said selected one of the plurality of different
commonIy-open TCP ports (see paragraph 35, lines 9-12, wherein another H.323
application receives the TCP connection); a second conversion table for reconverting
said converted plurality of packets (see paragraph 35, lines 9-12, wherein the other
H.323 application converts the single TCP connection back to the plurality of TCP and
UDP connections); and wherein said second interface distributes each of said plurality
of packets to said two or more ports (see fig. 3, wherein server 128 transmits the
multiport packets over a single port through firewall 124 to H.323 application 122, which
converts the single port packets back to multiport packets and delivers them to client
120); and wherein one or more firewalls are traversed between said first and second
network devices using said selected one of the plurality of different commonIy-open
ports (see paragraph 35, lines 4-5, open port 80 is used to traverse a firewall and see

paragraph 45, lines 13-17, wherein the port may be 23 for teInet).

For claim 6, Yim discloses a portion of said plurality of multiport packets

conforms to a first transmission protocol of said multiport communication protocol (see

Application/Control Number: 11/403,549 Page 5
Art Unit: 2419

paragraph 35, line 6, TOP protocol); another portion of said plurality of multiport packets
conforms to a second transmission protocol of said multiport communication protocol
(see paragraph 35, line 8, UDP protocol); and wherein said transmitting comprises
transmitting said plurality of singIe-port packets using said first transmission protocol in
said singIe-port communication protocol (see paragraph 35, lines 6-8, singIe-port

packets transmitted as TCP). Claims 7 and 16 are rejected for similar reasons.

For claim 8, Yim discloses sending alternate data instead of requested data in
response to a resend request (see paragraph 67, lines 1-8, wherein a request for
transmission does not result in a transmission of the same data, but rather alternate

data). Claim 17 is rejected for similar reasons.

For claim 9, Yim discloses qualifying said plurality of multiport packets, wherein
said qualifying comprises: registering a network device; using network ports by said
registered network device (see paragraph 40, lines 10-15, registering network device
and using ports by the device); determining whether said plurality of multiport packets
originated from a network port used by said registered network device; and allowing
further transmission of said plurality of multiport packets based on said determining (see
paragraph 40, lines 29-31, wherein the port is checked and transmission is allowed if

the port is registered). Claim 18 is rejected for similar reasons.

Application/Control Number: 11/403,549 Page 6
Art Unit: 2419

For claim 10, Yim discloses the commonIy-open port is a weII-known port (see
paragraph 45, lines 13-17, wherein well known port is 23 for teInet). Claim 19 is

rejected for similar reasons.

For claim 11, Yim discloses the commonIy-open port is port 443 (see paragraph
35, lines 6-12, wherein a commonly open port is used and can be changed from port 80

to port 443 as a matter of design choice). Claim 20 is rejected for similar reasons.

Claim Rejections - 35 USC § 103
2. The factual inquiries set forth in Graham v. John Deere Co., 383 US. 1, 148
USPQ 459 (1966), that are applied for establishing a background for determining
obviousness under 35 U.S.C. 103(a) are summarized as follows:
Determining the scope and contents of the prior art.
Ascertaining the differences between the prior art and the claims at issue.
Resolving the level of ordinary skill in the pertinent art.

Considering objective evidence present in the application indicating
obviousness or nonobviousness.

3. This application currently names joint inventors. In considering patentability of
the claims under 35 U.S.C. 103(a), the examiner presumes that the subject matter of
the various claims was commonly owned at the time any inventions covered therein
were made absent any evidence to the contrary. Applicant is advised of the obligation
under 37 CFR 1.56 to point out the inventor and invention dates of each claim that was

not commonly owned at the time a later invention was made in order for the examiner to

Application/Control Number: 11/403,549 Page 7
Art Unit: 2419

consider the applicability of 35 U.S.C. 103(c) and potential 35 U.S.C. 102(e), (f) or (9)

prior art under 35 U.S.C. 103(a).

4. The following is a quotation of 35 U.S.C. 103(a) which forms the basis for all

obviousness rejections set forth in this Office action:

(a) A patent may not be obtained though the invention is not identically disclosed or described as set
forth in section 102 of this title, if the differences between the subject matter sought to be patented and
the prior art are such that the subject matter as a whole would have been obvious at the time the
invention was made to a person having ordinary skill in the art to which said subject matter pertains.
Patentability shall not be negatived by the manner in which the invention was made.

Claims 2-5, 13-15, and 23-30 are rejected under 35 U.S.C. 103(a) as being
unpatentable over Yim in view of AdusimiIIi et al (cited 2003/0081783).

For claim 21, Yim discloses a method comprising: receiving at a first network
device a plurality of packets of data from two or more ports, said plurality of packets
having at least one original communication protocol (see paragraph 35, lines 6-8,
wherein a plurality of TCP and UDP connections are received at the firewall);
encapsulating the encrypted packets (see paragraph 46, lines 5-9, encapsulating the
packets) in a singIe-port communication protocol that is acceptable by any of a plurality
of different commonIy-open ports, thereby resulting in encapsulated packets (see
paragraph 35, line 8, wherein the single TCP connection is transmitted through open
port 80 and see paragraph 45, lines 13-17, wherein the port may be 23 for telnet);
transmitting from said first network device said encapsulated packets over a selected
one of the plurality of different commonIy-open ports (see paragraph 35, line 8, wherein

the single TCP connection is transmitted through open port 80 and see paragraph 45,

Application/Control Number: 11/403,549 Page 8
Art Unit: 2419

lines 13-17, wherein the port may be 23 for teInet), wherein said encapsulated packets
traverse one or more firewalls between said first and second network devices using said
selected one of the plurality of different commonIy-open ports (see paragraph 35, lines
4-5, open port 80 is used to traverse a firewall and see paragraph 45, lines 13-17,
wherein the port may be 23 for telnet); receiving at a second network device said
encapsulated packets from said selected one of the plurality of different commonIy-open
ports (see paragraph 35, lines 9-12, wherein another H.323 application receives the
TCP connection); restoring the decrypted packets to the at least one original
communication protocol, thereby resulting in restored packets (see paragraph 35, lines
9-12, wherein the other H.323 application converts the single TCP connection back to
the plurality of TCP and UDP connections); and distributing on from said second
network device each of said restored packets to said two or more ports (see fig. 3,
wherein server 128 transmits the multiport packets over a single port through firewall
124 to H.323 application 122, which converts the single port packets back to multiport
packets and delivers them to client 120).

Yim fails to disclose encrypting the packets, thereby resulting in encrypted
packets and decrypting the received encapsulated packets, thereby resulting in
decrypted packets. Adusimilli from the same or similar fields of endeavor teaches
encrypting the packets, thereby resulting in encrypted packets and decrypting the
received encapsulated packets, thereby resulting in decrypted packets (see paragraph
104, DES encryption and decryption). Thus, it would have been obvious to the person

of ordinary skill in the art at the time of the invention to incorporate the elements above

Application/Control Number: 11/403,549 Page 9
Art Unit: 2419

stated by AdusimiIIi in the network of Yim. The method taught by AdusimiIIi is
modified/implemented into the network of Yim by using encryption and decryption
methods. The motivation for encrypting the packets, thereby resulting in encrypted
packets and decrypting the received encapsulated packets, thereby resulting in

decrypted packets to keep the packets secure.

For claim 2, AdusimiIIi teaches encrypting said plurality of singIe-port packets in
said singIe-port communication protocol prior to said transmitting (see fig. 6, SSL
Conversion System 674, encrypts single port packets prior to transmission to server

690).

For claim 3, AdusimiIIi teaches decrypting said encrypted plurality of singIe-port
packets prior to said reconverting (see paragraph 55, lines 6-12, wherein the encrypted

single port packets are decrypted). Claims 13 and 22 are rejected for similar reasons.

For claim 4, AdusimiIIi teaches said encrypting is according to one of: an
Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) 128-bit algorithm; a Triple Data Encryption
Standard (TDES) algorithm; or a Skipjack algorithm (see paragraph 69, lines 13-17,
wherein the encryption is according to a Data Encryption Standard). Claims 14 and 23

are rejected for similar reasons.

Application/Control Number: 11/403,549 Page 10
Art Unit: 2419

For claim 5, Adusimilli teaches the singIe-port communication protocol
comprises: Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) protocol (see fig. 6, SSL Conversion System

674). Claims 15 and 24 are rejected for similar reasons.

For claim 25, Yim discloses a portion of said plurality of multiport packets
conforms to a first transmission protocol of said multiport communication protocol (see
paragraph 35, line 6, TOP protocol); another portion of said plurality of multiport packets
conforms to a second transmission protocol of said multiport communication protocol
(see paragraph 35, line 8, UDP protocol); and wherein said transmitting comprises
transmitting said plurality of singIe-port packets using said first transmission protocol in
said singIe-port communication protocol (see paragraph 35, lines 6-8, singIe-port

packets transmitted as TOP).

For claim 26, Yim discloses sending alternate data instead of requested data in
response to a resend request (see paragraph 67, lines 1-8, wherein a request for
transmission does not result in a transmission of the same data, but rather alternate

data).

For claim 27, Yim discloses qualifying said plurality of multiport packets, wherein
said qualifying comprises: registering a network device; using network ports by said
registered network device (see paragraph 40, lines 10-15, registering network device

and using ports by the device); determining whether said plurality of multiport packets

Application/Control Number: 11/403,549 Page 11
Art Unit: 2419

originated from a network port used by said registered network device; and allowing
further transmission of said plurality of multiport packets based on said determining (see
paragraph 40, lines 29-31, wherein the port is checked and transmission is allowed if

the port is registered).

For claim 28, Yim discloses the selected one of the plurality of different
commonIy-open port is a well-known port (see paragraph 45, lines 13-17, wherein well

known port is 23 for teInet).

For claim 29, Yim discloses the commonIy-open port is port 443 (see paragraph
35, lines 6-12, wherein a commonly open port is used and can be changed from port 80

to port 443 as a matter of design choice).

For claim 30, Yim discloses said singIe-port communication protocol is
acceptable by any of a plurality of different commonIy-open transmission control
protocol (TCP) ports (see paragraph 45, lines 13-17, wherein the port is 80 for HTTP

and 23 for telnet).

Response to Arguments
5. Applicant's arguments filed with respect to claims 1, 12, and 21 have been fully
considered but they are not persuasive. Applicant argues on page 10 of the Remarks

that Yim both fails to teach the newly amended converting multiport data to a singIe-port

Application/Control Number: 11/403,549 Page 12
Art Unit: 2419

communication protocol that is not HTTP and a singIe-port communication protocol that
is acceptable by any of a plurality ofdifferent commonIy-open TCP ports. Examiner
respectfully disagrees. As recited in paragraph 45, lines 13-17, Yim discloses “in one
embodiment, tunneling header 160 is a 40-byte header that indicates a specific
Hypertext transfer protocol (HTTP) port number, e.g., port number 80, or any other well-
known port, such as 23 for teInet”. Yim does not only disclose the conversion to HTTP
through port 80, but also the conversion to teInet via port 23, thereby teaching the

amended claims.

6. THIS ACTION IS MADE FINAL. Applicant is reminded of the extension of time
policy as set forth in 37 CFR 1.136(a).

A shortened statutory period for reply to this final action is set to expire THREE
MONTHS from the mailing date of this action. In the event a first reply is filed within
TWO MONTHS of the mailing date of this final action and the advisory action is not
mailed until after the end of the THREE-MONTH shortened statutory period, then the
shortened statutory period will expire on the date the advisory action is mailed, and any
extension fee pursuant to 37 CFR 1.136(a) will be calculated from the mailing date of
the advisory action. In no event, however, will the statutory period for reply expire later

than SIX MONTHS from the mailing date of this final action.

Remarks

Claims 1-23 are pending.

Response to Arguments
1. Applicant argues that “claim 9 is directed to recognized statutory subject
matter because the claimed "communication community" is expressly recited as

comprising devices, namely "one or more shared controllers connected to one or

 

more endpoint communication devices". It is first noted that the communication
community comprises "one or more shared controllers", "at least one individual
controller", and "an external controller". No endpoint devices are actually
claimed as being within this community. While the one or more shared
controllers may be connected to one or more endpoint communication devices,
the endpoint communication devices are n_ot part of the claimed communication
community, but rather merely entities connected to the controller. Therefore, one
must define what a “controller” can be.

Applicant argues that “The backend controllers (e.g., behind the firewalls)
are described as devices to which the endpoints are connected which manage
the communication interactions with the endpoints (see e.g., paragraph 0033),
and the backend controllers are described as being communicatively coupled
with the frontend controller." Nothing in paragraph 33 states that the backend
controller is a device. Applicant provides further arguments regarding the

functionality of the controllers, such as the frontend controller having an address,

such as an IP address or URL, and being operable to manage a multimedia

Application/Control Number: 11/403,548 Page 3
Art Unit: 2437

communication stream between endpoints. However, a logic entity such as
software can provide this functionality and have an address.

As the application does not define a controller to be inherently hardware,
one is left to define a controller in the realm of what one of ordinary skill in the art
would recognize. Looking to figure 4, one will see firewalls, controllers, switches,
and endpoints. Each is provided as its own separate entity within the figure.
Therefore, it appears logical that, in the absence of a distinct definition for any of
those entities, the broadest reasonable interpretation would encompass the
broadest definition for any of the entities of figure 4 that are actually defined. A
firewall is defined in the instant application as “Firewalls, which can be software,
hardware, or a combination of both” (paragraph 4). Therefore, the firewalls of
figure 4 can be software, hardware, or a combination thereof. An endpoint is
defined as “endpoints, 403-406, such as telephones, computer terminals, and the
like, that are configured for multimedia communication.” Therefore, an endpoint
appears as though it includes hardware. However, a controller is never defined
in the application as being hardware, software, or anything else. The broadest
reasonable interpretation for a controller is, therefore, the broadest reasonable
interpretation of an entity of figure 4, for example, which has been defined. As a
firewall has been defined as "software, hardware, or a combination of both", this
is the broadest reasonable interpretation that has been taken with respect to a
controller.

Applicant argues that “Applicant fails to understand how the controllers

could be construed as mere software that is not residing on or executing on

Application/Control Number: 11/403,548 Page 4
Art Unit: 2437

some hardware, as Applicant is aware of no such software that is operable in the
complete absence of hardware." Here, Applicant shows the distinction between
software and hardware. If a controller can be purely software, then the controller
is clearly not the device on which the controller resides. Therefore, there is no
hardware in the communication community of claim 9 in the case that the
controller is IogicaI/software, as the hardware on which the controller resides is
not claimed. It is noted that claim 19 has been added, dependent from claim 9,
and stating that "said one or more shared controllers, said at least one individual
controller, and said external controller each comprise a device.” If this claim
were incorporated into claim 9 (or even ifjust one of the 3 entities of claim 9 were
amended to state this aspect), the 101 issues would be fixed.

Applicant's arguments with respect to the prior art rejections of claims 1-23

have been considered but are moot in view of the new ground(s) of rejection.

Claim Objections
2. Claims 16, 17, and 19 are objected to because of the following
informalities:

- Claim 16 refers to “said first and second external communication
controllers”. It appears as though this should read “said first and
second external controllers”, in order to provide proper antecedent
basis. Claim 17 has a like issue referring to “said first external
communication controller” and “said second external

communication controller”.

Application/Control Number: 11/403,548 Page 5
Art Unit: 2437

- Claim 19 claims dependence on “The method of claim 9”.
However, claim 9 is a “communication community”, and not a
method.

Appropriate correction is required.

Claim Rejections - 35 USC § 101

35 U.S.C. 101 reads as follows:

Whoever invents or discovers any new and useful process, machine, manufacture, or
composition of matter, or any new and useful improvement thereof, may obtain a patent
therefor, subject to the conditions and requirements of this title.

3. Claims 9-13 are rejected under 35 U.S.C. 101 because the claimed
invention is directed to non-statutory subject matter.

Claim 9 is directed to “A communication community comprising:” one or
more shared controllers, at least one individual controller, and an external
controller. However, none of these controllers are defined in the application as
being physical entities (e.g. devices), logical entities (e.g. program code), or
anything at all. Therefore, these controllers are as broad as to be any entity that
can perform the functions of said controllers. As one can see, these controllers
may be hardware, software, or a combination thereof. Therefore, claim 9 fails to
fall in one of the statutory categories of invention, since it is not a process,
apparatus, article of manufacture, or composition of matter. None of claims 10-
13 fix this issue, therefore, claims 10-13 are rejected for the same reasons.

Claim 19, however, does fix this issue, as discussed above.

Claim Rejections - 35 USC § 103
The following is a quotation of 35 U.S.C. 103(a) which forms the basis for

all obviousness rejections set forth in this Office action:

(a) A patent may not be obtained though the invention is not identically disclosed or described
as set forth in section 102 of this title, if the differences between the subject matter sought to
be patented and the prior art are such that the subject matter as a whole would have been
obvious at the time the invention was made to a person having ordinary skill in the art to which
said subject matter pertains. Patentability shall not be negatived by the manner in which the
invention was made.

4. Claims 14-16, 22, and 23 are rejected under 35 U.S.C. 103(a) as being
unpatentable over AIt (US. Patent Application Publication 2007/0036143) in view
of Li (US. Patent Application Publication 2005/0080919).
Regarding Claim 14,
Alt discloses a method for communicating comprising:
Establishing a first communication connection between a
first internal controller behind a firewall and a first external controller
in a first communication community, the first external controller not
behind the firewall, wherein a first communication request is
initiated by a local communication device connected to the first
internal controller (Figures 2 and 6; and Paragraphs 48, 57, and 95-
97; the internal controllers may be the NAT devices, for example,
while the external controllers may be any portion of the service
provider network, such as SIP proxy server 611, ENUM, STUN,
TURN, or a combination thereof, for example);
Establishing a second communication connection between a

second internal controller behind a second firewall and a second

Application/Control Number: 11/403,548 Page 7
Art Unit: 2437

external controller in a second communication community, the
second external controller not behind the second firewall, wherein a
second communication request is initiated by a remote
communication device connected to the second internal controller
(Figures 2 and 6; and Paragraphs 48, 57, 58, and 95-100);

Responsive to one or more of the first and second
communication request requesting communication between the
local communication device and the remote communication device,
establishing a third communication connection between the first
and second external communication controllers (Figure 4; and
Paragraphs 95-100); and

Transmitting communication data between the first and
second communication communities through the third
communication connection (Paragraphs 95-100), wherein
transmitting comprises:

Receiving, at a first intermediate communication device that
is behind the firewall a plurality of multiport packets of data in a
multiport communication protocol for communication from the local
communication device in the first communication community
(Figure 2; and Paragraphs 40, 43, and 47);

Translating, by the first intermediate communication device,
the ports and/or addresses of the plurality of multiport packets

(Paragraph 40 and 47);

Application/Control Number: 11/403,548 Page 8
Art Unit: 2437

Transmitting, through the third communication connection,
the plurality of packets to a second intermediate communication
device that is behind the second firewall (Figures 2 and 4; and
Paragraphs 47 and 100-101);

Receiving the plurality of packets at the second intermediate
communication device (Figures 2 and 4; and Paragraphs 47 and
100-101);

Translating, by the second intermediate communication
device, the ports and/or addresses of the plurality of packets
(Figures 2 and 4; and Paragraphs 47 and 100-101);

Delivering, from the second intermediate communication
device to the remote communication device in the second
communication community, the reconverted plurality of multiport
packets using two or more ports associated with the multiport
communication protocol (Figure 4; and Paragraphs 44 and 100-
101);

But does not explicitly disclose that the translating performed
by the first intermediate communication device comprises
converting the plurality of multiport packets into a plurality of single
port packets in a single port communication protocol; transmitting
the plurality of single port packets; receiving the plurality of single
port; and that the translating performed by the second intermediate

communication device comprises reconverting the received plurality

Application/Control Number: 11/403,548 Page 9
Art Unit: 2437

of single port packets into the multiport communication protocol,
resulting in reconverted plurality of multiport packets.

Li, however, discloses that the translating performed by the
first intermediate communication device comprises converting the
plurality of multiport packets into a plurality of single port packets in
a single port communication protocol; transmitting the plurality of
single port packets; receiving the plurality of single port; and that
the translating performed by the second intermediate
communication device comprises reconverting the received plurality
of single port packets into the multiport communication protocol,
resulting in reconverted plurality of multiport packets (Paragraphs
28-29, 31-33, and 39). It would have been obvious to one of
ordinary skill in the art at the time of applicant's invention to
incorporate the port tunneling techniques of Li into the
communication system of AIt in order to allow the system to
communicate multiport multimedia data through existing firewalls,
while maintaining the high speed required for real time
communications and without providing a security hole by opening
many ports in the firewall.

Regarding Claim 15,

Alt as modified by Li discloses the method of claim 14, in

addition, AIt discloses verifying at the first external controller the

first communication request prior to establishing the first

Application/Control Number: 11/403,548 Page 10
Art Unit: 2437

communication connection (Figure 4; and Paragraphs 95-97, step
405, for example);

Verifying at the second external controller the second
communication request prior to establishing the second
communication connection (Figures 2, 4, and 6; and Paragraphs
48, 57, 58, and 95-100; as described above, either phone can
initiate communications and, in the case that the second endpoint
initiates communication, step 405 will be performed between the
second endpoint and the second controller).

Regarding Claim 16,

Alt as modified by Li discloses the method of claim 15, in
addition, Alt discloses issuing a third communication request
between the first and second external controllers (Figure 4; and
Paragraphs 95-100; such request comprising, for example, step
413); and

Verifying the third communication request prior to
establishing the third communication connection (Figure 4; and
Paragraphs 95-100; verification comprising, for example, the DNS
lookup and response in step 415).

Regarding Claim 22,

Alt as modified by Li discloses the method of claim 14, in

addition, AIt discloses that the first internal controller comprises the

first intermediate communication device, and wherein the second

Application/Control Number: 11/403,548 Page 11
Art Unit: 2437

internal controller comprises the second intermediate
communication device (Figure 2; and Paragraphs 40 and 47).
Regarding Claim 23,

Alt as modified by Li discloses the method of claim 14, in
addition, Li discloses that transmitting, through the third
communication connection, the plurality of single port packets to a
second intermediate communication device that is behind the
second firewall comprises transmitting the plurality of single port
packets over a commonly open port (Paragraphs 28-29, 31-33, and

39).

5. Claims 17 and 18 are rejected under 35 U.S.C. 103(a) as being
unpatentable over AIt in view of Li, further in view of Strathmeyer (US. Patent
Application Publication 2005/0122964).

Regarding Claim 17,

Alt as modified by Li does not appear to explicitly disclose
that establishing the third communication connection comprises
issuing a third communication request to a central communication
controller, establishing a first central communication channel
between the first external controller and the central communication
controller, issuing a fourth communication request from the central
communication controller to the second external controller, and

establishing a second central communication channel between the

Application/Control Number: 11/403,548 Page 12
Art Unit: 2437

central communication controller and the second external
controller.

Strathmeyer, however, discloses that establishing the third
communication connection comprises issuing a third
communication request to a central communication controller;
establishing a first central communication channel between the first
external controller and the central communication controller; issuing
a fourth communication request from the central communication
controller to the second external controller; and establishing a
second central communication channel between the central
communication controller and the second external controller
(Figures 6 and 7; and Paragraphs 52, 61, 63-65, and 74; as can be
seen, all communications go through all entities, therefore, in figure
6, for example, the outbound proxy could correspond to the first
external controller, while entity 602 may correspond to the central
controller. In figure 7, the proxy server may correspond to the first
external controller and the server 505 may correspond to the
central controller, which also connects to the SIP proxy 611 in the
combination, for example). It would have been obvious to one of
ordinary skill in the art at the time of applicant's invention to
incorporate the IP telephony system of Strathmeyer into the
communication system of AIt as modified by Li in order to allow the

system to provide call control and monitoring in a way that does not

Application/Control Number: 11/403,548 Page 13
Art Unit: 2437

affect the operation of current proxy servers and such that the
control and monitoring system has full access to all caII data,
thereby ensuring that all caII data is available for monitoring and
control and that the monitoring/control system makes fuIIy-informed
decisions and logs of the call data.

Regarding Claim 18,

Alt as modified by Li and Strathmeyer discloses the method
of claim 17, in addition, AIt discloses verifying the communication
requests at the central communication controller prior to
establishing the central communication channels (Figure 4; and
Paragraphs 95-100); and Strathmeyer discloses verifying the
communication requests prior to establishing the central
communication channels (Figures 6 and 7; and Paragraphs 52, 61,
63-65, and 74; such verification could be merely a response

provided back through the communication links, for example).

6. Claims 1-5, 9-13, and 19-21 are rejected under 35 U.S.C. 103(a) as being
unpatentable over AIt in view of Aasman (US. Patent Application Publication
2003/0065737) and Li.
Regarding Claim 1,
Alt discloses a method for a multimedia communication

comprising:

Application/Control Number: 11/403,548 Page 14
Art Unit: 2437

Receiving, at a controller that is behind a firewall and that is
communicatively coupled with a plurality of endpoint
communication devices, a plurality of multiport packets of data in a
multiport communication protocol for communication from at least
one of the plurality of endpoint communication devices (Figure 2;
and Paragraphs 40, 43, and 47; the controller may be the NAT
device or a combination of the NAT device with a proxy server; the
multiport packets comprising H.323 packets for example. It is
noted here that the word “controller” in the claim does not appear to
mean anything other than that the controller is some entity (e.g. a
device, a program, a portion of a device, a combination of devices
and/or programs). This is how controller has been construed.);

Translating, by the controller, the ports and/or addresses of
the plurality of multiport packets (Paragraph 40 and 47);

Receiving at an external controller a communication request
from the controller behind the firewall, wherein the external
controller is not behind the firewall (Figure 2; and Paragraphs 40,
47, 48, 57, and 95-97; the external controller may be the STUN,
ENUM, TURN, and/or a combination of them (e.g. any single entity
or the entirety of the service provider network));

Establishing a communication channel between the
controller and the external controller (Figure 3; and Paragraphs 40,

47, 57, and 95-97; steps 401, 403, and 413-415 correspond to such

Application/Control Number: 11/403,548 Page 15
Art Unit: 2437

establishment of communication between the controllers discussed
above, for example);

Opening a second communication channel between the
external controller and at least one other controller behind another
firewall (Paragraphs 47 and 97-100; communication with endpoint
209d being performed via the TURN server and NAT 209b);

Transmitting multimedia communication data between the
controller and the at least one other controIIer wherein the
multimedia communication data passes through the external
controIIer (Figures 2 and 4; and Paragraphs 47 and 100-101; the
endpoints exchanging media via the TURN server; this traffic going
through the firewalls on each side and the NAT devices on each
side, as one can see form the communication links of figure 2 and
the description of firewalls and NAT devices (paragraphs 39-40, for
example)): and

Distributing the multimedia communication data to one or
more of the plurality of endpoint communication devices and
another endpoint communication device (Figure 4; and Paragraphs
44 and 100-101);

But does not explicitly disclose that the at least one other
controller is configured to service a single endpoint, or that the

translating performed by the controller comprises converting the

Application/Control Number: 11/403,548 Page 16
Art Unit: 2437

plurality of multiport packets into a plurality of single port packets in
a single port communication protocol.

Aasman, however, discloses that the at least one other
controller is configured to service a single endpoint communication
device (Figure 1; and Paragraphs 64, 72-73, and 80-81; personal
proxy 9, for example, corresponding to a controller servicing a
single endpoint). It would have been obvious to one of ordinary
skill in the art at the time of applicant’s invention to incorporate the
proxy techniques of Aasman into the communication system of AIt
in order to allow for various user editable filters to be used in
proxies separate from and/or within the endpoints, such filters
allowing for the modification of data to be perceived by the user,
such that extraneous data can be removed and display of data can
be modified to meet screen resolutions/Iimitations.

Li, however, discloses that the translating performed by the
controller comprises converting the plurality of multiport packets
into a plurality of single port packets in a single port communication
protocol (Paragraphs 28-29, and 31-33; converting multiport
packets into single port packets by adding an extra tunneling
header thereon, conforming to TOP. In the combination, this
converting will be performed in the NAT of Alt). It would have been
obvious to one of ordinary skill in the art at the time of applicant's

invention to incorporate the port tunneling techniques of Li into the

Application/Control Number: 11/403,548 Page 17
Art Unit: 2437

communication system of AIt as modified by Aasman in order to
allow the system to communicate multiport multimedia data through
existing firewalls, while maintaining the high speed required for real
time communications and without providing a security hole by
opening many ports in the firewall.

Regarding Claim 2,

Alt as modified by Aasman and Li discloses the method of
claim 1, in addition, AIt discloses verifying the communication
request at the external controller (Paragraphs 68-72; authentication
via certificates, private keys, and/or shared keys, for example,
being performed by entities in the service provider network).

Regarding Claim 3,

Alt as modified by Aasman and Li discloses the method of
claim 1, in addition, AIt discloses transmitting a security key from
the controller to the external controller for authorization of the
communication request (Paragraphs 68-72).

Regarding Claim 4,

Alt as modified by Aasman and Li discloses the method of
claim 1, in addition, AIt discloses sending an external request from
the external controller to an additional external controller
responsive to the communication request requesting to
communicate with an additional endpoint communication device

connected to the additional external controller (Figures 2, 5, and 6a;

Application/Control Number: 11/403,548 Page 18
Art Unit: 2437

and Paragraphs 59 and 101-110; in the scenario of figure 5
(paragraphs 101 -1 05), gateway 215 may correspond to the
additional external controller, and an entity on the PSTN network
may correspond to the additional endpoint, such as the cell phone
217 or POTS phone 219, for example. In the scenario of figure 6a
(paragraphs 106-110), SIP proxy server 611 may correspond to the
additional external controller, while endpoints 605, 607, or 609 may
be the additional endpoint, for example).

Regarding Claim 5,

Alt as modified by Aasman and Li discloses the method of
claim 4, in addition, AIt discloses establishing an external channel
between the external controller and the additional external
controller; and forwarding the multimedia communication data to
the additional external controller from the external controller; and
distributing the multimedia communication data to the additional
endpoint communication device (Figure 2; and Paragraphs 59 and
101-110).

Regarding Claim 9,

Alt discloses a communication community comprising:

One or more shared controllers connected to one or more
endpoint communication devices, wherein the one or more shared
controllers is behind a firewall, and wherein the one or more shared

controllers is operable to translate the ports and/or addresses of the

Application/Control Number: 11/403,548 Page 19
Art Unit: 2437

plurality of multiport packets (Figure 2; and Paragraphs 40, 43, and
47);

At least one other controller connected to another endpoint
communication device, wherein the at least one other controller is
behind another firewall, and wherein the at least one other
controller is operable to translate the ports and/or addresses of the
plurality of multiport packets, and transmit to the other endpoint
communication device the translated plurality of multiport packets
using two or more ports associated with the multiport
communication protocol (Figures 2 and 4; and Paragraphs 40, 43,
47, and 100-101); and

An external controller in connection to the one or more
shared controllers and the at least one other controller, wherein the
external controller is not behind the firewall or the another firewall,
and wherein the external controller facilitates communication
between ones of the one or more endpoint communication devices
and the other endpoint communication device (Figure 3; and
Paragraphs 40, 47, 57, and 95-101);

But does not explicitly disclose that the at least one other
controller is an individual controller connected to a single
communication endpoint, that translating in the one or more shared
controllers comprises converting a plurality of multiport packets

received from the one or more endpoint communication devices

Application/Control Number: 11/403,548 Page 20
Art Unit: 2437

into a plurality of single port packets in a single port communication
protocol, or that translating in the one or more other controllers
comprises reconverting the plurality of single port packets into the
multiport communication protocol, resulting in reconverted plurality
of multiport packets.

Aasman, however, discloses that the at least one other
controller is an individual controller connected to a single
communication endpoint (Figure 1; and Paragraphs 64, 72-73, and
80-81; personal proxy 9, for example, corresponding to a controller
servicing a single endpoint). It would have been obvious to one of
ordinary skill in the art at the time of applicant’s invention to
incorporate the proxy techniques of Aasman into the
communication system of AIt in order to allow for various user
editable filters to be used in proxies separate from and/or within the
endpoints, such filters allowing for the modification of data to be
perceived by the user, such that extraneous data can be removed
and display of data can be modified to meet screen
resolutions/Iimitations.

Li, however, discloses that translating in the one or more
shared controllers comprises converting a plurality of multiport
packets received from the one or more endpoint communication
devices into a plurality of single port packets in a single port

communication protocol, or that translating in the one or more other

Application/Control Number: 11/403,548 Page 21
Art Unit: 2437

controllers comprises reconverting the plurality of single port
packets into the multiport communication protocol, resulting in
reconverted plurality of multiport packets (Paragraphs 28-29, 31-33,
and 39). It would have been obvious to one of ordinary skill in the
art at the time of applicant's invention to incorporate the port
tunneling techniques of Li into the communication system of AIt as
modified by Aasman in order to allow the system to communicate
multiport multimedia data through existing firewalls, while
maintaining the high speed required for real time communications
and without providing a security hole by opening many ports in the
firewall.

Regarding Claim 10,

Alt as modified by Aasman and Li discloses the community
of claim 9, in addition, AIt discloses a verification utility within the
external controller for verifying one or more communication
requests from one or more of the one or more shared controllers
and the individual controller (Paragraphs 68-72 and 82-83).

Regarding Claim 11,

Alt as modified by Aasman and Li discloses the community
of claim 9, in addition, AIt discloses a security key repository within
each of the one or more shared controllers and the individual
controller, wherein the one or more shared controllers and the

individual controller transmit a security key for verification by the

Application/Control Number: 11/403,548 Page 22
Art Unit: 2437

external controller for each communication request issued to the
external controller (Paragraphs 68-72 and 82-83; when a certificate
is allocated per island and stored on the respective island, this
certificate will be stored on a controller of the island (island being
defined as a closed community of IP-enabled users in paragraph 4
of Alt). If an endpoint also has a specific key or certificate, it will
also be temporarily stored in some fashion in the controller and
transmitted with requests).

Regarding Claim 12,

Alt as modified by Aasman and Li discloses the community
of claim 9, in addition, AIt discloses an external communication
interface within the external controller for communicating with a
second communication community (Figure 2).

Regarding Claim 13,

Alt as modified by Aasman and Li discloses the community
of claim 12, in addition, AIt discloses that the external controller
communicates with a central communication controller to establish
a communication channel with the second communication
community (Paragraphs 97-105; DNS Iookups to an ENUM server,
for example).

Regarding Claim 19,
Alt as modified by Aasman and Li discloses the community

of claim 9, in addition, AIt discloses that the one or more shared

Application/Control Number: 11/403,548 Page 23
Art Unit: 2437

controls, the at least one other controller, and the external controIIer
each comprise a device (Figure 2; and Paragraphs 40, 47, 48, 57,
and 209-218; showing hardware aspects of the devices of the
system).

Regarding Claim 20,

Alt as modified by Aasman and Li discloses the method of
claim 1, in addition, AIt discloses that transmitting the multimedia
communication data between the controller and the at least one
other controIIer comprises transmitting from the controller the
plurality of packets to the at least one other controller (Figures 2
and 4; and Paragraphs 47 and 100-101); and

Li discloses that transmitting the plurality of packets
comprises transmitting the plurality of single port packets over a
commonly open port to the at least one other controller, the plurality
of single port packets traversing one or more firewalls using the
commonly open port (Paragraphs 32 and 39; stripping/removing the
extra tunneling header, providing multiport packets once again).

Regarding Claim 21,

Alt as modified by Aasman and Li discloses the method of
claim 20, in addition, AIt disclose receiving the plurality of packets
at the at least one other controller, and delivering, from the at least
one other controller to another endpoint communication device, the

plurality of multiport packets using two or more ports associated

Application/Control Number: 11/403,548 Page 24
Art Unit: 2437

with the multiport communication protocol (Figures 2 and 4; and
Paragraphs 47 and 100-101);

Aasman discloses that the another endpoint communication
device is the single endpoint communication device (Figure 1; and
Paragraphs 64, 72-73, and 80-81); and

Li discloses receiving the plurality of single port packets at
the at least one other controller (Paragraphs 32 and 39);

Reconverting, by the at least one other controller, the
received plurality of single port packets into the multiport
communication protocol, resulting in reconverted plurality of
multiport packets (Paragraphs 32 and 39); and

Delivering, from the at least one other controller to the single
endpoint communication device, the reconverted plurality of
multiport packets using two or more ports associated with the

multiport communication protocol (Paragraphs 32 and 39).

7. Claims 6-8 are rejected under 35 U.S.C. 103(a) as being unpatentable
over AIt in view of Aasman and Li, further in view of Strathmeyer.
Regarding Claim 6,
Alt as modified by Aasman and Li discloses the method of
claim 1, in addition, AIt discloses a communication request
requesting to communicate with an external endpoint device not

connected to one or more of the controller and the at least one

Application/Control Number: 11/403,548 Page 25
Art Unit: 2437

other controIIer (Figure 2; and Paragraphs 59 and 101-110); but
does not explicitly disclose issuing a central request from the
external controller to a central controIIer responsive to the
communication request requesting to communicate with an external
endpoint device not connected to one or more of the controller and
the at least one other controller and receiving the multimedia
communication data at the central controller.

Strathmeyer, however, discloses issuing a central request
from the external controller to a central controIIer responsive to the
communication request requesting to communicate with an external
endpoint device not connected to one or more of the controller and
the at least one other controller and receiving the multimedia
communication data at the central controller (Figures 6 and 7; and
Paragraphs 52, 61, 63-65, and 74; in this situation, the elements
described above as the central controller, and the external
controller will comprise the passthrough server, the proxy server,
and/or the server in figure 7, for example; or the outbound proxy of
figure 6, for example). It would have been obvious to one of
ordinary skill in the art at the time of applicant's invention to
incorporate the IP telephony system of Strathmeyer into the
communication system of AIt as modified by Aasman and Li in
order to allow the system to provide call control and monitoring in a

way that does not affect the operation of current proxy servers and

Application/Control Number: 11/403,548 Page 26
Art Unit: 2437

such that the control and monitoring system has full access to all
caII data, thereby ensuring that all caII data is available for
monitoring and control and that the monitoring/control system
makes fuIIy-informed decisions and logs of the call data.
Regarding Claim 7,

Alt as modified by Aasman, Li, and Strathmeyer discloses
the method of claim 6, in addition, AIt discloses determining a
peripheral controller connected to the external endpoint device;
opening another external channel between the central controller
and the peripheral controller; forwarding the multimedia
communication data to the peripheral controller from the central
controller; and distributing the multimedia communication data to
the external endpoint device (Figure 2; and Paragraphs 59 and
101-110; as discussed above, in the combination, entities in the
service provider network may be construed as the central
controller; and as discussed with respect to claims 4 and 5 above,
the gateway may be the peripheral controller in this claim, for
example).

Regarding Claim 8,

Alt as modified by Aasman, Li, and Strathmeyer discloses

the method of claim 6, in addition, AIt discloses distributing the

multimedia communication data to the external endpoint device

Application/Control Number: 11/403,548 Page 27
Art Unit: 2437

when the external endpoint device is connected to the central

controller (Figure 2; and Paragraphs 59 and 101-110).

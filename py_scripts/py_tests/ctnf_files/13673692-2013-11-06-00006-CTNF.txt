DETAILED ACTION
The present application is being examined under the pre-AIA first to invent
provisions. This Office Action is in response to patent application S/N: 13/673,692,

filed on November 09, 2012. Claims 1- 43 are pending in the Action.

Information Disclosure Statement
The Information Disclosure Statement filed on 11/09/2012 was being considered

by the examiner.

Dra wings

Drawings filed on 11/09/2013 are acceptance for examination.

Double Patenting
1. The nonstatutory double patenting rejection is based on a judicially created
doctrine grounded in public policy (a policy reflected in the statute) so as to prevent the
unjustified or improper timewise extension of the “right to exclude” granted by a patent
and to prevent possible harassment by multiple assignees. A nonstatutory double
patenting rejection is appropriate where the claims at issue are not identical, but at least
one examined application claim is not patentany distinct from the reference claim(s)
because the examined application claim is either anticipated by, or would have been
obvious over, the reference claim(s). See, e.g., In re Berg, 140 F.3d 1428, 46 USPQ2d

1226 (Fed. Cir. 1998); In re Goodman, 11 F.3d 1046, 29 USPQ2d 2010 (Fed. Cir.

Application/Control Number: 13/673,692 Page 3
Art Unit: 2128

1993); In re Longi, 759 F.2d 887, 225 USPQ 645 (Fed. Cir. 1985); In re Van Ornum,
686 F.2d 937, 214 USPQ 761 (CCPA 1982); In re Vogel, 422 F.2d 438, 164 USPQ 619
(CCPA 1970); and In re Thorington, 418 F.2d 528, 163 USPQ 644 (CCPA 1969).

A timely filed terminal disclaimer in compliance with 37 CFR 1.321 (c) or 1.321(d)
may be used to overcome an actual or provisional rejection based on a nonstatutory
double patenting ground provided the reference application or patent either is shown to
be commonly owned with this application, or claims an invention made as a result of
activities undertaken within the scope of a joint research agreement. A terminal

disclaimer must be signed in compliance with 37 CFR 1.321(b).

2. The USPTO internet Web site contains terminal disclaimer forms which may be
used. Please visit http://www.uspto.gov/forms/. The filing date of the application will
determine what form should be used. A web-based eTerminaI Disclaimer may be filled
out completely online using web-screens. An eTerminaI Disclaimer that meets all

requirements is auto-processed and approved immediately upon submission.

3. Claims 1-43 are rejected on the ground of nonstatutory double patenting as being
unpatentable over claims 1-33 of U.S. Patent No. 8,332,203. Although the claims at
issue are not identical, they are not patentany distinct from each other because they
are all related to a method and system for emulating an application executing in real

time in a mobile device, the method comprising:

Application/Control Number: 13/673,692 Page 4
Art Unit: 2128

emulating the mobile device in real time using a model running on a processor
extrinsic to the mobile device, wherein the model is based on characteristics indicative
of performance of the mobile device; executing the application in real time within the
model; and

monitoring the application executing in the model to determine resource
utilization information by the application for the mobile device; and displaying the
resource utilization information for the mobile device.

The claims in the US patent do not require “an online market place" as in the
instant claimed application. It would be obvious to those skilled in the art at the time of
the invention was made to analyze and understand the application in mobile device is
configured for user from the market place upon request from the user to send

application to the mobile device via online.

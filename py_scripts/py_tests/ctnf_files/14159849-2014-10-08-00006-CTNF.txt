Claim Rejections - 35 USC § 103
The following is a quotation of pre—AIA 35 USC. 103(a) which forms the basis for all

obviousness rejections set forth in this Office action:

(a) A patent may not be obtained though the invention is not identically disclosed or described as set
forth in section 102 of this title, if the differences between the subj ect matter sought to be patented and
the prior art are such that the subject matter as a whole would have been obvious at the time the
invention was made to a person having ordinary skill in the art to which said subject matter pertains.
Patentability shall not be negatived by the manner in which the invention was made.

1. Claims 1—20 are rejected under pre—AIA 35 USC. 103(a) as being unpatentable

over Hayes, Jr. et al. (US# 5,974,312) in View of Anderson (US# 5,995,603).

Referring to Claims 1—20, Hayes, Jr. et a1. disclose an electronic device (100) (i.e. a
programmable communicator device) (column 2 lines 18 to 34; see Figure 1) comprising:
a wireless communications circuit (195) having an antenna (118) and configured to communicate

over a communications network (column 5 lines 43 to 53; see Figure 2);

Application/Control Number: 14/ 159,849 Page 4
Art Unit: 2682

A non—volatile programmable memory (136) (i.e. a programmable identity module)
having an electronic serial number (ESN) (i.e. a unique identifier associated with the
programmable communicator (100)) (column 6 lines 27 to 34; see Figure 2);

A system connector interface (180) (i.e. a programmable interface) connected to at least
one external component (i.e. an attached monitoring device) (column 5 lines 61 to 67; see Figure
2);

A micro—controller (120) (i.e. a processing module) configured to receive and
authenticate an at least one transmission from a wireless programmer (200) (i.e. a programming
transmitter), the at least one transmission including at least one telephone number or IP address
(see Figures 5A to SC), wherein the processing module (120) is configured to authenticate the at
least one transmission by determining if the at least one transmission contains the ESN (i.e. a
unique identifier).

However, Hayes, Jr. et a1. did not explicitly disclose that wherein the programmable
communicator device is configured to use a memory to store at least one telephone number or IP
address included within at least one of the transmissions as a list of one or more linked numbers
to which the programmable communicator device may send outgoing wireless transmissions;
wherein the one or more wireless transmissions from the programming transmitter comprises a
General Packet Radio Service (GPRS) or other wireless packet switched data message; and
wherein the programmable communicator device is configured to process data received through
the programmable interface from the at least one monitored technical device in response to

programming instructions received in an incoming wireless packet switched data message.

Application/Control Number: l4/ 159,849 Page 5
Art Unit: 2682

At the same field of endeavor of a communication system, Anderson discloses that a
memory module (52) configured to store the at least one telephone number from the
authenticated transmission as one of a plurality of authorized list of callers to allow phone to
communicate with the incoming callers (column 3 lines 50 to 57; column 5 lines 31 to 45; see
Figure 3 and 5) in order to generate a distinctive ring for the caller or by redirecting the call to a
separate telephone or to an answering machine for only authorized list of callers.

At the time of the invention, it would have been obvious to a person of ordinary skill in
the art to recognize the need to use a memory to store the telephone number from authenticated
signal as an authorized callers taught by Anderson in an the electronic device for updating a
memory Via a wireless data transfer of Hayes, J r. et al. because having a memory to store the
authorized list of caller would improve an arrangement for screening incoming telephone calls
for convenient of the user.

Using the wireless transmissions from the programming transmitter comprises a General
Packet Radio Service (GPRS) or other wireless packet switched data message; and wherein the
programmable communicator device is configured to process data received through the
programmable interface from the at least one monitored technical device in response to
programming instructions received in an incoming wireless packet switched data message are
well—known.

Therefore, it would have been obvious to one of ordinary skill in the art at the time the
invention was made to modify the wireless communication interface for receiving data over the

wireless communication channel Hayes, Jr. et al. in View of Anderson with the GPRS wireless

Application/Control Number: 14/ 159,849 Page 6
Art Unit: 2682

transmission because this would provide an alternate wireless communication interface for

wireless data transfer in the programing unit.

Double Patenting

The nonstatutory double patenting rejection is based on a judicially created doctrine
grounded in public policy (a policy reﬂected in the statute) so as to prevent the unjustified or
improper timewise extension of the “right to exclude” granted by a patent and to prevent possible
harassment by multiple assignees. A nonstatutory obviousness—type double patenting rejection
is appropriate where the conﬂicting claims are not identical, but at least one examined
application claim is not patentably distinct from the reference c1aim(s) because the examined
application claim is either anticipated by, or would have been obvious over, the reference
c1aim(s). See, e.g., In re Berg, 140 F.3d 1428, 46 USPQ2d 1226 (Fed. Cir. 1998); In re
Goodman, 11 F.3d 1046, 29 USPQ2d 2010 (Fed. Cir. 1993); In re Longi, 759 F.2d 887, 225
USPQ 645 (Fed. Cir. 1985); In re Van Ornnm, 686 F.2d 937, 214 USPQ 761 (CCPA 1982); In re
Vogel, 422 F.2d 438, 164 USPQ 619 (CCPA 1970); and In re Thorington, 418 F.2d 528, 163
USPQ 644 (CCPA 1969).

A timely filed terminal disclaimer in compliance with 37 CFR 1.321(c) or 1.321(d) may
be used to overcome an actual or provisional rejection based on a nonstatutory double patenting
ground provided the conﬂicting application or patent either is shown to be commonly owned
with this application, or claims an invention made as a result of activities undertaken within the
scope of a joint research agreement.

Effective J anuary 1, 1994, a registered attorney or agent of record may sign a terminal
disclaimer. A terminal disclaimer signed by the assignee must fully comply with 37 CFR
3.73(b).

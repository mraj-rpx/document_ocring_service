DETAILED ACTION
Double Patenting

1. The nonstatutory double patenting rejection is based on a judicially created
doctrine grounded in public policy (a policy reflected in the statute) so as to prevent the
unjustified or improper timewise extension of the “right to exclude” granted by a patent
and to prevent possible harassment by multiple assignees. A nonstatutory
obviousness-type double patenting rejection is appropriate where the conflicting claims
are not identical, but at least one examined application claim is not patentably distinct
from the reference claim(s) because the examined application claim is either anticipated
by, or would have been obvious over, the reference claim(s). See, e.g., In re Berg, 140
F.3d 1428, 46 USPQ2d 1226 (Fed. Cir. 1998); In re Goodman, 11 F.3d 1046, 29
USPQ2d 2010 (Fed. Cir. 1993); In re Longi, 759 F.2d 887, 225 USPQ 645 (Fed. Cir.
1985); In re Van Ornum, 686 F.2d 937, 214 USPQ 761 (CCPA 1982); In re Vogel, 422
F.2d 438, 164 USPQ 619 (CCPA 1970); and In re Thorington, 418 F.2d 528, 163 USPQ
644 (CCPA 1969).

A timely filed terminal disclaimer in compliance with 37 CFR 1.321 (c) or 1.321(d)
may be used to overcome an actual or provisional rejection based on a nonstatutory
double patenting ground provided the conflicting application or patent either is shown to
be commonly owned with this application, or claims an invention made as a result of

activities undertaken within the scope of a joint research agreement.

Application/Control Number: 13/566,986 Page 3
Art Unit: 2642

Effective January 1, 1994, a registered attorney or agent of record may sign a
terminal disclaimer. A terminal disclaimer signed by the assignee must fully comply with

37 CFR 3.73(b).

2. Claims 1-16 are rejected on the ground of nonstatutory obviousness-type double
patenting as being unpatentable over claims 1-19 of U.S. Patent No. 8,009,646.
Although the conflicting claims are not identical, they are not patentably distinct from
each other because they both teach similar methods and apparatus for overlapping
mimo antenna physical sectors. Further, the claims of the instant application are

generic to all that is recited in the claims of the copending application.

3. Claims 1-16 are rejected on the ground of nonstatutory obviousness-type double
patenting as being unpatentable over claims 1-19 of U.S. Patent No. 8,111,678.
Although the conflicting claims are not identical, they are not patentably distinct from
each other because they both teach similar methods and apparatus for overlapping
mimo antenna physical sectors. Further, the claims of the instant application are

generic to all that is recited in the claims of the copending application.

4. Claims 1-16 are rejected on the ground of nonstatutory obviousness-type double
patenting as being unpatentable over claims 1-18 of U.S. Patent No. 7,348,930.
Although the conflicting claims are not identical, they are not patentably distinct from

each other because they both teach similar methods and apparatus for overlapping

Art Unit: 2642

mimo antenna physical sectors. Further, the claims of the instant application are

generic to all that is recited in the claims of the copending application.

5. Claims 1-16 provisionally rejected on the ground of nonstatutory obviousness-
type double patenting as being unpatentable over claims 1-18 of copending Application
No. 13/118,386. Although the conflicting claims are not identical, they are not
patentably distinct from each other because they both teach similar methods and
apparatus for overlapping mimo antenna physical sectors. Further, the claims of the
instant application are generic to all that is recited in the claims of the copending
application.

This is a grovisional obviousness-type double patenting rejection because the

conflicting claims have not in fact been patented.

6. Claims 1-16 provisionally rejected on the ground of nonstatutory obviousness-
type double patenting as being unpatentable over claims 1-8 of copending Application
No. 13/118,406. Although the conflicting claims are not identical, they are not
patentably distinct from each other because they both teach similar methods and
apparatus for overlapping mimo antenna physical sectors. Further, the claims of the
instant application are generic to all that is recited in the claims of the copending
application.

This is a grovisional obviousness-type double patenting rejection because the

conflicting claims have not in fact been patented.

7. Claims 1-16 provisionally rejected on the ground of nonstatutory obviousness-
type double patenting as being unpatentable over claims 1-12 of copending Application
No. 13/348,523. Although the conflicting claims are not identical, they are not
patentably distinct from each other because they both teach similar methods and
apparatus for overlapping mimo antenna physical sectors. Further, the claims of the
instant application are generic to all that is recited in the claims of the copending
application.

This is a grovisional obviousness-type double patenting rejection because the

conflicting claims have not in fact been patented.

8. Claims 1-16 provisionally rejected on the ground of nonstatutory obviousness-
type double patenting as being unpatentable over claims 1-15 of copending Application
No. 13/218,185. Although the conflicting claims are not identical, they are not
patentably distinct from each other because they both teach similar methods and
apparatus for overlapping mimo antenna physical sectors. Further, the claims of the
instant application are generic to all that is recited in the claims of the copending
application.

This is a grovisional obviousness-type double patenting rejection because the

conflicting claims have not in fact been patented.

Application/Control Number: 13/566,986 Page 6
Art Unit: 2642

9. Claims 1-16 provisionally rejected on the ground of nonstatutory obviousness-
type double patenting as being unpatentable over claims 18-37 of copending
Application No. 13/192,181. Although the conflicting claims are not identical, they are
not patentably distinct from each other because they both teach similar methods and
apparatus for overlapping mimo antenna physical sectors. Further, the claims of the
instant application are generic to all that is recited in the claims of the copending
application.

This is a grovisional obviousness-type double patenting rejection because the

conflicting claims have not in fact been patented.

Claim Rejections - 35 USC § 102
10. Claims 1-16 are rejected under 35 U.S.C. 102(e) as being anticipated by
Lastinger et al (US 7,349,701).

The applied reference has a common assignee with the instant application.
Based upon the earlier effective U.S. filing date of the reference, it constitutes prior art
under 35 U.S.C. 102(e). This rejection under 35 U.S.C. 102(e) might be overcome
either by a showing under 37 CFR 1.132 that any invention disclosed but not claimed in
the reference was derived from the inventor of this application and is thus not the
invention “by another,” or by an appropriate showing under 37 CFR 1.131.

Regarding claims 1, 6 and 12, Lastinger teaches a system for wirelesst
communicating with provided wireless devices via a plurality of multipIe-input-multiple-

output ("MIMO") antennas (see Abstract, column 5, lines 34-39, column 8, lines 12-16

Application/Control Number: 13/566,986 Page 7
Art Unit: 2642

and column 10, lines 50-54, also see column 6, lines 33-35, column 7, lines 35-37,
column 10, Iines17-21 and column 10, lines 41-49), the system comprising: a first radio
group comprising a first MIMO physical sector for communicating using a first channel
(see fig.1-6 and fig.23-26, column 1, lines 38-57, column 3, lines 23-28 and column 6,
line 9 to column 8, line 59), and a second radio group comprising a second MIMO
physical sector for communicating using a second channel (see fig.1-6 and fig.23-26,
column1,|ines 38-57, column 3, lines 23-28 and column 6, line 9 to column 8, line 59),
wherein: the first MIMO physical sector overlaps at least 30 percent of an area of the
second MIMO physical sector thereby forming an area of overlap (see fig.1-6 and fig.23-
26, column 1, lines 38-57, column 3, lines 23-28 and column 6, line 9 to column 8, line
59), a frequency of the first channel is different from a frequency of the second channel
(see column 6, lines 33-48, column 7,Iines12-31 and column 8, line 60 to column 9,
line 5), each radio group respectively further comprises: a phased array, and at least
two radios coupled to the phased array, the radios cooperate with the phase array to
form a plurality of physical sectors (see fig.1-6 and fig.23-26, column 1, lines 38-57,
column 3, lines 23-28 and column 6, line 9 to column 8, line 59), each physical sector
having an angle of coverage less than 360 degrees (see column 3, lines 11-28), each
physical sector of the plurality at least partially overlaps the other physical sectors of the
plurality to form the MIMO physical sector of the radio group (see fig.1-6 and fig.23-26,
column1,|ines 38-57, column 3, lines 23-28 and column 6, line 9 to column 8, line 59),
the physical sectors of the phased array operate as a MIMO antenna (see fig.1-6 and

fig.23-26, column 1, lines 38-57, column 3, lines 23-28 and column 6, line 9 to column 8,

Application/Control Number: 13/566,986 Page 8
Art Unit: 2642

line 59, also see column 5, lines 34-39, column 8, Iines12-16 and column 10, lines 50-
54, also see column 6, lines 33-35, column 7, lines 35-37, column 10, Iines17-21 and
oolumn10,|ines 41-49).

Regarding claims 2 and 7, Lastinger teaches the first MIMO physical seotor
substantially overlaps the second MIMO physical seotor thereby forming the area of
overlap (see fig.1-6 and fig.23-26, column 1, lines 38-57, column 3, lines 23-28 and
column 6, line 9 to column 8, line 59).

Regarding claims 3 and 8, Lastinger teaches the first radio group communicates
with a first provided wireless device via the first MIMO physical sector in the area of
overlap using the first channel, and the second radio group communicates with a
second provided wireless device via the second MIMO physical sector in the area of
overlap using the second channel (see fig.1-6 and fig.23-26, column 1, lines 38-57,
column 3, lines 23-28 and column 6, line 9 to column 8, line 59).

Regarding claims 4 and 10, Lastinger teaches the radios of the first radio group
communicate using a first protocol, the radios of the second radio group communicate
using a second protocol, and the first protocol is different from the second protocol (see
column 5, lines 47-51).

Regarding claims 5, 11 and 16, Lastinger teaches the first protocol includes the
IEEE 802.1 in protocol, and the second protocol includes at least one of the Worldwide
Interoperability for Microwave Access ("WiMax") and the Long Term Evolution ("LTE")
protocol (see column 5, lines 47-51).

Regarding claim 9, Lastinger teaches the first radio group communicates with a

Application/Control Number: 13/566,986 Page 9
Art Unit: 2642

first provided wireless device and the second radio group communicates with a second
provided wireless device in a same area of overlap (see fig.1-6 and fig.23-26, column 1,
lines 38-57, column 3, lines 23-28 and column 6, line 9 to column 8, line 59).

Regarding claim 13, Lastinger teaches the first communication protocol uses a
first channel, the second communication protocol uses a second channel, and the first
channel is different from the second channel (see column 6, lines 33-48, column 7, lines
12-31 and column 8, line 60 to column 9, line 5).

Regarding claim 14, Lastinger teaches the first channel uses a first frequency,
the second channel uses a second frequency, the first frequency is different from the
second frequency (see column 6, lines 33-48, column 7, Iines12-31 and column 8, line
60 to column 9, line 5).

Regarding claim 15, Lastinger teaches the first communication protocol
communicates with a mobile computer, and the second communication protocol

communicates with a mobile phone (see column 5, lines 47-51).

Claim Rejections - 35 USC § 102
11. The following is a quotation of the appropriate paragraphs of 35 U.S.C. 102 that

form the basis for the rejections under this section made in this Office action:

A person shall be entitled to a patent unless —

(a) the invention was known or used by others in this country, or patented or described in a printed
publication in this or a foreign country, before the invention thereof by the applicant for a patent.

12. Claims 1-3, 6-9 and 12-14 are rejected under 35 U.S.C. 102(a) as being

anticipated by Kitchener et al (US 6,870,515).

Application/Control Number: 13/566,986 Page 10
Art Unit: 2642

Regarding claims 1, 6 and 12, Kitchener teaches a system for wirelesst
communicating with provided wireless devices via a plurality of multipIe-input-multiple-
output ("MIMO") antennas (see fig.17, fig.19, fig.20 column 3, lines 31 -36, column 11,
lines 24-32 and column 12, lines 49-50, also see Abstract, column 2, lines 59-65,
column 8, Iines10-42 and column 10, lines 28-36), the system comprising: a first radio
group comprising a first MIMO physical sector for communicating using a first channel
(see column 6, line 30 to column 8, line 17), and a second radio group comprising a
second MIMO physical sector for communicating using a second channel (see column
11, lines 19-53), wherein: the first MIMO physical sector overlaps at least 30 percent of
an area of the second MIMO physical sector thereby forming an area of overlap (see

Art Unit: 2642

Regarding claims 2 and 7, Kitchener teaches the first MIMO physical sector
substantially overlaps the second MIMO physical sector thereby forming the area of
overlap (see column 11, lines 19-53).

Regarding claims 3 and 8, Kitchener teaches the first radio group communicates
with a first provided wireless device via the first MIMO physical sector in the area of
overlap using the first channel (see column 11, lines 19-53), and the second radio group
communicates with a second provided wireless device via the second MIMO physical

Claim Rejections - 35 USC § 103
13. The following is a quotation of 35 U.S.C. 103(a) which forms the basis for all

obviousness rejections set forth in this Office action:

(a) A patent may not be obtained though the invention is not identically disclosed or described as set
forth in section 102 of this title, if the differences between the subject matter sought to be patented and
the prior art are such that the subject matter as a whole would have been obvious at the time the
invention was made to a person having ordinary skill in the art to which said subject matter pertains.
Patentability shall not be negatived by the manner in which the invention was made.

14. This application currently names joint inventors. In considering patentability of
the claims under 35 U.S.C. 103(a), the examiner presumes that the subject matter of
the various claims was commonly owned at the time any inventions covered therein
were made absent any evidence to the contrary. Applicant is advised of the obligation
under 37 CFR 1.56 to point out the inventor and invention dates of each claim that was
not commonly owned at the time a later invention was made in order for the examiner to
consider the applicability of 35 U.S.C. 103(c) and potential 35 U.S.C. 102(e), (f) or (9)
prior art under 35 U.S.C. 103(a).
15. Claims 4, 5, 10, 11, 15 and 16 are rejected under 35 U.S.C. 103(a) as being
unpatentable over Kitchener et al (US 6,870,515) in view of Hou et al (US 7,415,288).

Regarding claims 4 and 10, Kitchener teaches claims 1, 6 and 12. Kitchener
does not specifically disclose the radios of the first radio group communicate using a
first protocol, the radios of the second radio group communicate using a second
protocol, and the first protocol is different from the second protocol.

Hou teaches the radios of the first radio group communicate using a first

protocol, the radios of the second radio group communicate using a second protocol,

Application/Control Number: 13/566,986 Page 13
Art Unit: 2642

and the first protocol is different from the second protocol (see column 1, line 42 to
column 2, line 13, “IEEE”. In addition, see Official notice below).

Therefore, it would have been obvious to one of ordinary skill in the art at the
time the invention was made to provide the teaching of Hou into the system of Kitchener
in order to provide transmission diversity with intentional partial beam pattern overlays
to improve oeII seotorization or frequency re-use factor, at the same time, reduce intra-
oeII and inter-oeII interference (see Hou, Abstract).

Regarding claims 5, 11 and 16, the combination of Kitchener and Hou further
teaches the first protocol includes the IEEE 802.1 in protocol, and the second protocol
includes at least one of the Worldwide Interoperability for Microwave Access ("WiMax")
and the Long Term Evolution ("LTE") protocol (see Hou, Abstract and column 1, line 42
to column 2, line 13, “IEEE”. In addition, see Official notice below).

Regarding claim 15, the combination of Kitchener and Hou further teaches the
first communication protocol communicates with a mobile computer, and the second
communication protocol communicates with a mobile phone (see Hou, Abstract and

column 1, line 42 to column 2, line 13, “IEEE”. In addition, see Official notice below).

16. Claims 4, 5, 10, 11, 15 and 16 are rejected under 35 U.S.C. 103(a) as being

unpatentable over Kitchener et al (US 6,870,515) in view of Official notice.
Regarding claims 4 and 10, Kitchener teaches claims 1, 6 and 12. Kitchener

does not specifically disclose the radios of the first radio group communicate using a

first protocol, the radios of the second radio group communicate using a second

Application/Control Number: 13/566,986 Page 14
Art Unit: 2642

protocol, and the first protocol is different from the second protocol. However, the
examiner takes Official notice that such feature as recited is very well known in the art
for reducing interferences. Therefore, it would have been obvious to one of ordinary
skill in the art at the time of the invention was made to modify the above teaching of
Kitchener for providing a method as claimed, for the radios of the first radio group
communicate using a first protocol, the radios of the second radio group communicate
using a second protocol, and the first protocol is different from the second protocol.

Regarding claims 5, 11 and 16, Kitchener teaches claims 1, 6 and 12. Kitchener
does not specifically disclose the first protocol includes the IEEE 802.1 in protocol, and
the second protocol includes at least one of the Worldwide Interoperability for
Microwave Access ("WiMax") and the Long Term Evolution ("LTE") protocol. However,
the examiner takes Official notice that such feature as recited is very well known in the
art for reducing interferences. Therefore, it would have been obvious to one of ordinary
skill in the art at the time of the invention was made to modify the above teaching of
Kitchener for providing a method as claimed, for the first protocol includes the IEEE
802.1 in protocol, and the second protocol includes at least one of the Worldwide
Interoperability for Microwave Access ("WiMax") and the Long Term Evolution ("LTE")
protocol.

Regarding claim 15, Kitchener teaches claims 1, 6 and 12. Kitchener does not
specifically disclose the first communication protocol communicates with a mobile
computer, and the second communication protocol communicates with a mobile phone.

However, the examiner takes Official notice that such feature as recited is very well

Application/Control Number: 13/566,986 Page 15
Art Unit: 2642

known in the art for reducing interferences. Therefore, it would have been obvious to
one of ordinary skill in the art at the time of the invention was made to modify the above
teaching of Kitchener for providing a method as claimed, for the first communication
protocol communicates with a mobile computer, and the second communication

protocol communicates with a mobile phone.

17. Claims 1-16 are rejected under 35 U.S.C. 103(a) as being unpatentable over
Hou et al (US 7,415,288) in view of Kitchener et al (US 6,870,515).

Regarding claims 1, 6 and 12, Hou teaches a system for wirelesst
communicating with provided wireless devices via a plurality of multipIe-input-multiple-
output ("MIMO") antennas (see fig.1 b to fig.3 and fig.6 to fig.8, also see fig.5, column 3,
Iines15-52,a|so see column 1, lines 20-41, column 3, line 53 to column 4, line 6 and
column, 5, line 54 to column 6, line 11), the system comprising: a first radio group
comprising a first MIMO physical sector for communicating using a first channel, and a
second radio group comprising a second MIMO physical sector for communicating
using a second channel (see fig.1 b to fig.3, fig.6 to fig.8, and see fig.4 and see column
3, lines 8 to column 4, line 6, column 5, line 26 to column 6, line 48, column 7, Iines14-
36 and column 7, line 58 to column 8, line 9), wherein: the first MIMO physical sector
overlaps at least 30 percent of an area of the second MIMO physical sector thereby
forming an area of overlap (see fig.1 b to fig.3, fig.6 to fig.8, and see fig.4 and see
column 3, lines 8 to column 4, line 6, column 5, line 26 to column 6, line 48, column 7,

lines 14-36 and column 7, line 58 to column 8, line 9), a frequency of the first channel is

different from a frequency of the second channel (see column 1, line 21 to column 2,
line 13), each radio group respectively further comprises: at least two radios, the radios
cooperate to form a plurality of physical sectors (see fig.4 and see column 3, lines 8 to
column 4, line 6, column 5, line 26 to column 6, line 48, column 7, Iines14-36 and
column 7, line 58 to column 8, line 9, also see fig.1 b to fig.3, fig.6 to fig.8), each physical
sector having an angle of coverage less than 360 degrees (see fig.4 and fig.6), each
physical sector of the plurality at least partially overlaps the other physical sectors of the
plurality to form the MIMO physical sector of the radio group (see fig.4 and see column
3, lines 8 to column 4, line 6, column 5, line 26 to column 6, line 48, column 7,Iines14-
36 and column 7, line 58 to column 8, line 9, also see fig.1 b to fig.3, fig.6 to fig.8), the
physical sectors operate as a MIMO antenna (see fig.5, column 3, lines 15-52, also see
oolumn1,|ines 20-41, column 3, line 53 to column 4, line 6 and column, 5, line 54 to
column 6, Iine11).

Hou does not specifically disclose a phased array, and at least two radios
coupled to the phased array, the radios cooperate with the phase array to form a
plurality of physical sectors, the physical sectors of the phased array operate as a
MIMO antenna.

Kitchener teaches a phased array (see column 10, lines 14-27 and column 11,
lines 24-27), and at least two radios coupled to the phased array (see column 10, lines
14-27 and column 11, lines 24-27), the radios cooperate with the phase array to form a
plurality of physical sectors (see column 10, lines 14-27 and column 11, lines 19-53),

the physical sectors of the phased array operate as a MIMO antenna (see column 11,

lines 19-53, also see Abstract, column 2, lines 59-65, column 8, lines10-42 and column
10, lines 28-36).

Therefore, it would have been obvious to one of ordinary skill in the art at the
time the invention was made to provide the teaching of Kitchener into the system of Hou
in order to provide a compact antenna unit, while still allowing a MIMO system to be
exploited, the present invention recognizes that polarization diversity only can be used
in a MIMO system without the need for spatially diverse antenna elements (see
Kitchener, Abstract).

Regarding claims 2 and 7, the combination of Hou and Kitchener further teaches
the first MIMO physical seotor substantially overlaps the second MIMO physical seotor
thereby forming the area of overlap (see Hou, fig.4 and see column 3, lines 8 to column
4, line 6, column 5, line 26 to column 6, line 48, column 7, Iines14-36 and column 7,
line 58 to column 8, line 9, also see fig.1 b to fig.3, fig.6 to fig.8, also see fig.5, column 3,
lines 15-52, also see column 1, lines 20-41, column 3, line 53 to column 4, line 6 and
column, 5, line 54 to column 6, line11,and/or see Kitchener, column 11, lines19-53).

Regarding claims 3 and 8, the combination of Hou and Kitchener further teaches
the first radio group communicates with a first provided wireless device via the first
MIMO physical sector in the area of overlap using the first channel, and the second
radio group communicates with a second provided wireless device via the second
MIMO physical sector in the area of overlap using the second channel (see Hou, fig.4
and see column 3, lines 8 to column 4, line 6, column 5, line 26 to column 6, line 48,

column 7, lines14-36 and column 7, line 58 to column 8, line 9, also see fig.1b to fig.3,

fig.6 to fig.8, also see fig.5, column 3, Iines15-52, also see column 1, lines 20-41,
column 3, line 53 to column 4, line 6 and column, 5, line 54 to column 6, line 11 , and/or
see Kitchener, column 11, lines 19-53).

Regarding claims 4 and 10, Hou teaches the radios of the first radio group
communicate using a first protocol, the radios of the second radio group communicate
using a second protocol, and the first protocol is different from the second protocol (see
Abstract and column 1, line 42 to column 2, line 13, “IEEE”).

Regarding claims 5, 11 and 16, Hou teaches the first protocol includes the IEEE
802.1 in protocol, and the second protocol includes at least one of the Worldwide
Interoperability for Microwave Access ("WiMax") and the Long Term Evolution ("LTE")
protocol (see Abstract and column 1, line 42 to column 2, line 13, “IEEE”).

Regarding claim 9, the combination of Hou and Kitchener further teaches the first
radio group communicates with a first provided wireless device and the second radio
group communicates with a second provided wireless device in a same area of overlap
(see Hou, fig.1 b to fig.3, fig.6 to fig.8, and see fig.4 and see column 3, lines 8 to column
4, line 6, column 5, line 26 to column 6, line 48, column 7, Iines14-36 and column 7,
line 58 to column 8, line 9, and/or see Kitchener, column 11, Iines19-53).

Regarding claim 13, the combination of Hou and Kitchener further teaches the
first communication protocol uses a first channel, the second communication protocol
uses a second channel (see Hou, Abstract and column 1, line 42 to column 2, line 13,
“IEEE”), and the first channel is different from the second channel (see Hou, Abstract

and column 1, line 42 to column 2, line 13, “IEEE”, and/or see Kitchener, column 6, line

Application/Control Number: 13/566,986 Page 19
Art Unit: 2642

30 to column 8, line 17).

Regarding claim 14, the combination of Hou and Kitchener further teaches the
first channel uses a first frequency, the second channel uses a second frequency, the
first frequency is different from the second frequency (see Hou, column 1, line 21 to
column 2, line 13, and/or see Kitchener, column 6, line 30 to column 8, Iine17).

Regarding claim15, Hou teaches the first communication protocol communicates
with a mobile computer, and the second communication protocol communicates with a

mobile phone (see Abstract and column 1, line 42 to column 2, line 13, “IEEE”).

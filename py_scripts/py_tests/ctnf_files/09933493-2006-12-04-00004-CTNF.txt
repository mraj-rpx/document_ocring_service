DETAILED ACTION
This Ofﬁce'Action is in response to Amendment filed September 11, 2005. Claims 20-
21 are cancelled as requested by Applicants. Claims 1-15, 17, 24-27, 29 are presented
for further examination. Claims 34-37 are newly added and are presented for initial

examination.

Claim Rejections - 35 USC § 103
1. The following is a quotation of 35 U.S.C. 103(a) which forms the basis for all

obviousness rejections set forth in this Office action:

(a) A patent may not be obtained though the invention is not identically disclosed or described as set
forth in section 102 of this title, if the differences between the subject matter sought to be patented and
the prior art are such‘ that the subject matter as a whole would have been obvious at the time the
invention was made to a person having ordinary skill in the art to which said subject matter pertains.
Patentability shall not be negatived by the manner in which the invention was made.’

2. Claims 1- 15, 17, 24-27, 29-37 are rejected under 35 U.S.C. 103(a) as being
unpatentable over Zimowski et al. (hereinafter “Zim”, US Pateht 5,632,015) in view of

Spaey et al. (hereinafter “Spaey", US Patent Publication 2002/0055981 A1).

As per claims 1, 24, 29, 32-33, Zim discloses a system, user interface
mechanism, and method of providing session-based retrieval and at a client system of
string-based» content from a server comprising:

0 - A communication protocol that enables session based connection between a

client system and a server system, and allows the client system to send, within-a

single session between the client system and the server system, a plurality of

Application/Control Number: 09/933,4931 Page 3
Art Unit: 2157

consecutively input query strings, to query the server system for string-based
content (column 2, Iines18-23, 27-30, 55-58, column 3, lines 40-45);

. - A client object, in communication with a client software at the client system and
with the communication piotocol, wherein'the client object receives additional
characters from the client software, and as each character is being received,
transmits to a seryer object at the server system a plurality of consecutive queries,
within the same session, to retrieve content from the server system, wherein each
consecutive query one of lengthens or shortens the query string by additional
characters, and forms an increasingly focused query string for retrieving matching
content from the server system (column 2, lines 40-45, column 3, lines 48-67,
column 8, lines 18-29, 45-63);

0 - A server object, in communication with the server system, and with the client
object via the communication protocol, wherein the server object in response to
receiving each consecutive query as it lengthens or shortens the query string by the

‘ additional characters, automatically matches the increasingly focused query string
against the content of the server system (column 2, lines 47-58, column 3, lines 1-
10, column 4, lines 3-14, 44-61).

Zim does not explicitly disclose:

. A communication protocol that enables an asynchronous session based connection

. between a client system and a server system;
0 Asynchronousiy returns increasingly relevant content information to the client object

for immediate'use by the client system.

Application/Control Number: 09/933,493 Page 4
Art Unit: 2157

However, it is well-known to one of ordinary skill in the art the advantages of using a
communication protocol that enables an asynchronous session and asynchronously
returning relevant content as evidenced by Spaey (paragraphs [0004, 0157, 0167]).
Therefore, ene or ordinary skill in the art at the time the invention was made
would have found it obvious to incorporate or implement Spaey's asynchronous session
and asynchronously returning relevant content in Zim's system allowihg search to take

place for each character.

As per claim 2, Zim discloses the system of claim 1 wherein said client object operates
on or at a first computer and said server object operates on or at a secOnd computer
and wherein both of said first and said second computers are connected via a network

protocol (column 3, lines 40-60, column 4, lines 3-15).

As per claim 3, Zim discloses the system of claim 1 wherein said server object and
said client object runs on the same computer (column 4, lines 66-67, column 5, lines 1-

3)..

As per claim 4, Zim discloses the system of claim 1 wherein said server object runs
on a plurality of separate computers, and wherein said client queries received during the

session are distributed over said separate computers (column 4, lines 3-15).

Application/Control Number:109/933,493 Page 5
Art Unit: 2157 ~ '

As per claim 5, Zim discloses the system of claim 1 wherein said server object stores
previously received strings and returns said stored strings to the client in response to
new client queries received during the session, without accessing said content (column

4, lines 30-55).

As per claim 6, Zim further discloses the system of claim 1 wherein said client
software is embedded into a software application that provides a visual interface to an

operator (column 3, lines 48-67).

As per claim 7, Zim discloses the system of claim 1 wherein said client software is

used as a content engine for another software system (column 3, lines 50-58).

As per claim 8, Zim discloSes the system of claim 1 wherein said client software
accumulates. a plurality of said single character queries as they are entered into the
client, before sending them together to said server as a single query string (column 4,

lines 15-25).

As per claim 9, Zim discloses the system of claim 1 wherein said client software
stores previously received responses from the server and uses these as the response

to a new query by the user, without reassessing the server (column 8, lines 9-20).

Application/Control Number: 09/933,493 ' Page 6
Art Unit: 2157

' As per claim 10, Zim discloses the system of claim 1 wherein said client software
stores a pre-defined string and automatically transmits it to the server as the client
software is first accessed, and wherein additional entry of query characters is not

required before server responses are sent to the client (column 8, lines 30-45).

As per claim 11, Zim discloses the system of claim 1 wherein said server stores the
state of query and response of the client software, and restores the state of the client

softWare after any interruption in said communication protocol (column 9, lines 20-43).

As per claim 12, Zim discloses the system of claim 1 where said client software adds
a qualifier to the query that is-passed to the server, whereby the server can use said
qualifier'to execute the query and return appropriate results based on both the query

A string and its qualifier (column 7, lines 43-55).

As per claim 13, Zim discloses the system of claim 1 where said client software
identifies a user of the system to the server whereby the server can store statistics and
provides a history of queries and corresponding responses appropriate to said user

(column 8, lines 45-60).

As per claim 14, Zim discloses the system of claim 1 where said server system
comprises a_ server tier and a syndication tier, and wherein said client software

communicates to the server tier on a single computer, and wherein each query is

Application/Control Number: 09/933,493 Page 7
Art Unit: 2157

forwarded by the server tier and the syndication tier to an appropriate syndicate of

content channels connected to the server tier on a different computer (column 9, lines

. 40-57).

As per claim 15, Zim discloses the system of claim 1 where said server applies a
content dependent pattern and filter to characters received from the client before

queries are matched against the content (column 6, lines 45-64).

As per claim 17, Zim further discloses the system of claim 1 where server responses
comprise lists of strings, wherein each string is‘ accompanied by corresponding
metadata, whereby the metadata"contains logical links to other data sources of Uniform

Resource Identifiers (column 7, lines 20-40).

As per claim 25, Zim discloses themechanism of claim 24, wherein said user

interface element is an application input ﬁeld (column 5, lines 56-60).

As per claim 26, Zim discloses the mechanism of claim 24, wherein said session
indicator displays a triangular display element to indicate the presence of said session,
and does not display said triangular display element to indicate the absenee of said

session (column 6, lines 1-13).

Application/Control Number: 09/933,493 ' Page 8
Art Unit: 2157 '

As per claim 27, Zim discloses the mechanism of claim 24, wherein said status
indicator displays one, or a plurality of arrow display elements to indicate the transfer of
data from said client application to said server during said session, and the presence of

available session-specific content at said server (column 6, lines 23-41).

As per claim 30, Zim discloses the system of claim 21 wherein the server object
matches each query received form the client against an in-memory cache, and returns
cached content to the client without accessing said content engine, unlees the cached

_content has expired since it was last received from said content engine (column 9, lines

1-25).

As per claim 31, Zim discloses the system of claim 21, wherein the server
analyzes the time between said consecutive queries received from each client system,
and skips selected ones of said consecutive queries to reduce network communications

and the load on said content engine (column 9, lines 45-67).

As per claim 34, Zim discloses the system of claim 1, whereby“ the client object
indicates the selection of the contentsources to be queried to the server when
said session is initiated and when centent source selection changes are needed
thereafter, without needing to embed said content source selection witheach of

said consecutive string-based queries (column 12, lines 30-55).

Application/Control Number: 09/933,493 ' ' Page 9
Art Unit: 2157

As perclaim 35, Zim discloses the system of claim 1 .whereby said session is

shared by multiple client objects that exchange messages with the same server

system, whereby each client object identifies a different content source selection to

which said consecutive queries from the individual client object will be mapped by

its corresponding server object (column 11, lines 40-65).

As.per claims 36-37, Zim discloses a system and method for providing session-

based searching of string-based content from a server, comprising:

a user interface that allows a user at a client to enter a string of consecutively

input queries to query the server for string-based content, wherein each
consecutive query lengthens the query string by one or more additional characters
(column 2, lines 18-23, 27-30, 55-58, column 3, lines 40-45);

a communication protocol that transmits, via a client object at said client, to a

server object at the server, the plurality of consecutive queries, to retrieve content
from the sewer, wherein each additional character is immediately transmitted to

the server object as the user is entering the additional characters in the user

interface, to form an increasingly focused query string for retrieving content from

the server (column 2, Iinesﬁ40-45, column 3, lines 48-67, Column 8, lines 18-29, 45-
63);

aserver object which in response to receiving each query as it is being

lengthened or shortened by the one or more additional characters, automatically

matches the increasingly focused query string against the content of the server,

Application/Control Number: 09/933,493 . Page 10
Art Unit: 2157

and, as the user is entering queries (column 2, lines 47-58, column 3, lines 1-10,
column 4, lines 3-14, 44-61.
.Zim does not explicitly disclose:

. A communication protocol that enabtes an asynchronous session based connection
between a client system and a server system; .

. Asynchronously returns increasingly‘relevant content’information to the client object
for immediate use by the client system.

However,fit is well-known to one of ordinary skill in the art the advantages of using a

communication protocol that enables an asynchronous session and asynchronously

returning relevant content as evidenced by Spaey (paragraphs [0004, 0157, O167]).

Therefore, one or ordinary skill in the art at the time the invention was made
would have found it obvious to incorporate or implement Spaey’s asynchronous session
and asynchronously returning relevant content in Zim’s system allowing search to take

place for each character.

Response to Arguments
(d) Applicant's argument has been considered but is moot in view of the new

ground(s) of rejection.

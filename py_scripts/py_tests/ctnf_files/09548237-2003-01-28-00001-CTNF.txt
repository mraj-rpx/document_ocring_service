Application/Control Number: 09/548,237 Page 2
Art Unit: 2155

DETAILED ACTION
Claim Rejections - 35 USC § 112

1. The following is a quotation of the ﬁrst paragraph of 35 U.S.C. 112:

The specification shall contain a written description of the invention, and of the manner and process of
making and using it, in such fuII, clear, concise, and exact terms as to enable any person skilled in the
art to which it pertains, or with which it is most nearly connected, to make and use the same and shall
set forth the best mode contemplated by the inventor of carrying out his invention.

2. Claims 1, 3, and 14 are rejected under 35 U.S.C. 112, ﬁrst paragraph, as
containing subject matter which was not described in the speciﬁcation in such a way as
to enable one skilled in the art to which it pertains, or with which it is most nearly
connected, to make and/or use the invention. Applicant has not provided a detailed
disclosure of “counting requests exclusive of repeated requests from common clients”.
The examiner is aware of page 7, lines 17-18 and page 14, lines 9-11 of the disclosure
where applicant states “counting requests excluding repeated requests from common
clients” if there is further enablement please indicate the corresponding areas of the
disclosure.

3. Applicant’s apparent lack of detail corresponding to the claimed limitation of
“counting requests exclusive of repeated requests from common clients” suggests an
obvious variation. It is generally understood that the state of the art at the time of the
invention as understood by the inventor can be determined by the degree of detail in the
disclosure and that which is left for one of ordinary skill in the art to perform is presumed
to be within the skill in the art to perform. As applicant has supplied no detail enabled of

this alleged nonobvious process by which to “count requests exclusive of repeated

Application/Control Number: 09/548,237 Page 3
Art Unit: 2155

requests from common clients” it is presumed to be within the skill of the art (In re Fox
176 USPQ 340).

4. The remaining dependent claims are rejected on the same rationale as
previously rejected claims 1, 3 and 14.

5. After review of applicant’s statements filed on November 15, 2002 concerning the
above rejection, the examiner requests applicant point to portions of the disclosure in
question which couples “appending a session identifier” to “counting requests exclusive

of repeated requests from common clients".

Claim Rejections - 35 USC § 103

1. The text of those sections of Title 35, US. Code 103 not included in this action
can be found in a prior Ofﬁce action.
2. Claims 1-2, 7-10 are rejected under 35 U.S.C. 103(a) as being unpatentable over
Lara D. Catledge et al., Characterizing Browsing Strategies in the WorId-Wide Web
(hereafter referred to as Cartledge) in view of José Kahan, A capability-based
authorization model for the World Wide Web (hereafter referred to as Kahan).
3. Regarding claim 1, Catledge taught a method of processing service requests
from a client to a server system through a network, said comprising the steps of:

responding to requests for information received from the client through the

network by returning the requested information to the client (users request documents

through www.gatech.edu, page 3); and

Application/Control Number: 09/548,237 Page 4
Art Unit: 2155

counting requests to particular information (“A modiﬁed version of the Pattern
Detection Module (PDM) algorithm user navigation”, page 5) and excluding repeated
requests to said information from a common client (mechanism to separate per-user
information, page 5).

Catledge does not speciﬁcally teach appending a session identiﬁer to the
requests. However, Kahan taught appending a session identifier to the requests
(appending Ddcap, 2.3 Consultation phase, pages 4-5). It would have been obvious to
one of ordinary skill in the art at the time the invention was made that incorporating
Kahan’s appending the session identifier in Catledge’s system for tracking world wide
web access would have improved system security. The motivation would have been to
ensure that only authorized users access sites outside of the www.gatech.edu server.
4. Regarding dependent claim 2, Catledge taught comprising excluding from the
counting requests made for information from the client within a deﬁned period of time
(“The PDM analysis five times.” page 6).

5. Regarding dependent claim 7, Catledge does not speciﬁcally teach the session
identifier is cryptographically generated. However, Catledge taught the session identiﬁer
is cryptographically generated (pages 9-10). It would have been obvious to one of
ordinary skill in the art at the time the invention was made that incorporating Kahan’s
cryptographically generated session identifier in Catledge’s system for accessing
document would have improved system security. The motivation would have been to

ensure that no unauthorized user access sites outside the www.gatechedu server.

r

Application/Controi Number: 09/548,237 Page 5
Art Unit: 2155
6. Regarding dependent claim 8, Catledge taught the excluding requests comprises

excluding requests from a particular user (per-session and per-user, page 6).
7. Regarding dependent claim 9, Catledge taught the particular user is identiﬁed by
the appended session identiﬁer (user id, page 4).
8. Regarding dependent claim 10, Catledge taught further comprising:

logging requests in a transaction log (“original log file occurrence”, page 4);
and

evaluating the transaction log to determine request counts (“A modified version of

the Pattern Detection Module (PDM) algorithm user navigation”, page 5).

Claim Rejections - 35 USC § 102
9. The following is a quotation of the appropriate paragraphs of 35 USC. 102 that

form the basis for the rejections under this section made in this Ofﬁce action:

A person shall be entitled to a patent unless —

(a) the invention was known or used by others in this country, or patented or described in a printed
publication in this or a foreign country, before the invention thereof by the applicant for a patent.

10. Claims 3-6 and 11-12 rejected under 35 USC. 102(a) as being anticipated by
Lara D. Catledge et al., Characterizing Browsing Strategies in the WorId-Wide Web
(hereafter referred to as Cartledge).

11. Regarding claim 3, Catledge taught an information server on a network,

comprising:

Application/Control Number: 09/548,237 Page 6
Art Unit: 2155

means for responding to requests for service received from a client through a
network by returning the requested service to the client (users request documents
through www.gatechedu, page 3); and

means for counting requests to a particular service (“A modiﬁed version of the
Pattern Detection Module (PDM) algorithm user navigation”, page 5) and excluding
repeated requests to said information from a common client (mechanism to separate
per-user information, page 5).

12. Regarding dependent claim 4, Catledge taught the requests include a common
session identiﬁer (user id, page 4) and the server tracks requests within a session of
requests (“A modified version of the Pattern Detection Module (PDM) user
navigation.” page 5).

13. Regarding dependent claim 5, Catledge taught further comprising means for
excluding requests made to a service from the client within a deﬁned period of time
(excluding other session information from per-session tabulation, page 6).

14. Regarding dependent claim 6, Catledge taught communications to and from the
client are according to hypertext transfer protocol (“Document requests WWW
servers.” page 4).

15. Regarding dependent claim 11, Catledge taught said means for counting and
excluding requests comprises means for excluding requests from a particular user (“per-
session” tabulation excludes user’s other sessions, page 6).

16. Regarding dependent claim 12, Catledge taught the particular user is identiﬁed

by a user identiﬁer (user id, page 4).

Application/Control Number: 09/548,237 Page 7
Art Unit: 2155

17. Regarding dependent claim 13, Catledge taught further comprising:

means for logging requests in a transaction log (“original log ﬁle occurrence",
page 4); and

means for determining request counts from the transaction log (“A modified
version of the Pattern Detection Module (PDM) algorithm user navigation", page 5).
18. Regarding claim 14, Catledge taught a method of processing service requests 4
from a client to a server system through a network (tracking web site access), said
method comprising the steps of:

responding to requests for service received from a client through a network by
returning the requested service to the client (users browse documents through
www.gatechedu, page 3); and

counting requests to particular service (“A modified version of the Pattern
Detection Module (PDM) algorithm user navigation, page 5) and excluding repeated
requests to said service from a common client (mechanism to separate per-user

information, page 5).

Response to Arguments
19. Applicant's arguments ﬁled November 15, 2002 have been fully considered but,
they are not persuasive.
20. Applicant argues — “Nowhere does Catledge discuss actually processing user

requests.”

Application/Control Number: 09/548,237 Page 8
Art Unit: 2155

3. Applicant admits Catledge “recorded and analyzed client events”.
Applicant leaves out that the client events are “user requests”. Thus, Catledge
records and analyzes (Le. determines the frequency) of user requests. Therefore,
applicant’s assertion is moot.
21. Applicant argues —- “Catledge does not teach excluding counting requests
excluding requests from common client.”
b. Catledge taught separating “per-usef’ frequency information from the
analyzed data.
22. Applicant argues — “Dcap refers to delegated document capabilities and is not
equivalent of a session identifier."
c. Dcap is appended to a uniform resource locator (URL), is cryptographically
generated and is used to control access to documents. All these are features of
applicant’s “session identiﬁer (SID)”.
23. Applicant argues — “Catledge does not teach counting requests to a particular
service and excluding repeated requests from a common client.”
d. Catledge taught separating “per-user” frequency information from the

analyzed data.

DETAILED ACTION
This Ofﬁce Action is in response to Request for Continuation Examination (RCE) ﬁled
December 21, 2005. Claims 16, 18, 19, 22, 23, and 28 are cancelled as requested by
Applicants. Claims 1-15, 17, 20-21, 24-27, 29 are presented for further examination.

Claims 30-33 are presented for initial examination.

Claim Rejections - 35 USC § 102
1. The following is a quotation of the appropriate paragraphs of 35 U.S.C. 102 that

form the basis for the rejections under this section made in this Ofﬁce action:

A person shall be entitled to a patent unless —

(b) the invention was patented or described in a printed publication in this or a foreign country or in public
use or on sale in this country, more than one year prior to the date of application for patent in the United
States.

2. Claims 1- 15, 17, 20-21, 24-27, 29-33 are rejected under 35 U.S.C. 102(b) as

being anticipated by Zimowski et ai. (hereinafter “Zim”, US Patent 5,632,015).

As per claims 1, 20-21, 24, 29, 32-33, Zim discloses a system, user interface
mechanism, and method of providing session-based retrieval and at a client system of
string-based content from a server comprising:

A communication protocol that enables an asynchronous session based
connection between a client system and a server system, and allows the client system

to send, within a single session between the client system and the server system, a

Application/Control Number: 09/933,493 Page 3
Art Unit: 2157

plurality of consecutively input query strings, to query the server system for content
(column 2, lines 18-23, 27-30, 55-58, column 3, lines 40-45);

A client object, in communication with a client software at the client system and
with the communication protocol, wherein the client object transmits to a server object at
the server system a plurality of consecutive queries, within the same session, to retrieve
content from the server system, wherein each consecutive query one of lengthens or
shortens the query string by one or more characters, and forms an increasingly focused
query string for retrieving content from the server system (column 2, |ines 40-45, column
3, lines 48-67, column 8, lines 18-29, 45-63);

A server object, in communication with the server system, and in communication
with the client object via the communication protocol, wherein the server object records,
during the session, each of the plurality of consecutive queries for the client system, and
in response to receiving each query as it is being lengthen or shortened by one or more
characters, automatically matches the focused query string against the content of the
server system, and asynchronously returns increasingly relevant content information to
the client object for immediate use by the client system (column 2, lines 47-58, column

3, Iines1-10, column 4, lines 3-14, 44-61).

As per claim 2, Zim discloses the system of claim 1 wherein said client object
operates on or at a first computer and said server object operates on or at a second
computer and wherein both of said ﬁrst and said second computers are connected via a

network protocol (column 3, lines 40-60, column 4, lines 3-15).

Application/Control Number: 09/933,493 Page 4
Art Unit: 2157

As per claim 3, Zim discloses the system of claim 1 wherein said server object and
said client object runs on the same computer (column 4, lines 66-67, column 5, lines 1-

3).

As per claim 4, Zim discloses the system of claim 1 wherein said server object runs
on a plurality of separate computers, and wherein said client queries received during the

session are distributed over said separate computers (column 4, lines 3-15).

As per claim 5, Zim discloses the system of claim 1 wherein said server object stores
previously received strings and returns said stored strings to the client in response to
new client queries received during the session, without accessing said content (column

4, lines 30-55).

As per claim 6, Zim further discloses the system of claim 1 wherein said client
software is embedded into a software application that provides a visual interface to an

operator (column 3, lines 48-67).

As per claim 7, Zim discloses the system of claim 1 wherein said client software is

used as a content engine for another software system (column 3, lines 50-58).

Application/Control Number: 09/933,493 Page 5
Art Unit: 2157

As per claim 8, Zim discloses the system of claim 1 wherein said client software
accumulates a plurality of said single character queries as they are entered into the
client, before sending them together to said server as a single query string (column 4,

lines 15-25).

As per claim 9, Zim discloses the system of claim 1 wherein said client software
stores previously received responses from the server and uses these as the response

to a new query by the user, without reassessing the server (column 8, lines 9-20).

As per claim 10, Zim discloses the system of claim 1 wherein said client software
stores a pre-deﬁned string and automatically transmits it to the server as the client
software is ﬁrst accessed, and wherein additional entry of query characters is not

required before server responses are sent to the client (column 8, lines 30-45).

As per claim 11, Zim discloses the system of claim 1 wherein said server stores the
state of query and response of the client software, and restores the state of the client

software after any interruption in said communication protocol (column 9, lines 20-43).

As per claim 12, Zim discloses the system of claim 1 where said client software adds
a qualiﬁer to the query that is passed to the server, whereby the server can use said
qualiﬁer to execute the query and return appropriate results based on both the query

string and its qualiﬁer (column 7, lines 43-55).

Application/Control Number: 09/933,493 Page 6
Art Unit: 2157

As per claim 13, Zim discloses the system of claim 1 where said client software
identiﬁes a user of the system to the server whereby the server can store statistics and
provides a history of queries and corresponding responses appropriate to said user

(column 8, lines 45-60).

As per claim 14, Zim discloses the system of claim 1 where said server system
comprises a server tier and a syndication tier, and wherein said client software
communicates to the server tier on a single computer, and wherein each query is
forwarded by the server tier and the syndication tier to an appropriate syndicate of
content channels connected to the server tier on a different computer (column 9, lines

40-57).

As per claim 15, Zim discloses the system of claim 1 where said server applies a
content dependent pattern and ﬁlter to characters received from the client before

queries are matched against the content (column 6, lines 45-64).

As per claim 17, Zim further discloses the system of claim 1 where server responses
comprise lists of strings, wherein each string is accompanied by corresponding
metadata, whereby the metadata contains logical links to other data sources of Uniform

Resource Identiﬁers (column 7, lines 20-40).

Application/Control Number: 09/933,493 Page 7
Art Unit: 2157

As per claim 25, Zim discloses the mechanism of claim 24, wherein said user

interface element is an application input ﬁeld (column 5, lines 56-60).

As per claim 26, Zim discloses the mechanism of c|aim 24, wherein said session
indicator displays a triangular display element to indicate the presence of said session,
and does not display said triangular display element to indicate the absence of said

session (column 6, lines 1-13).

As per claim 27, Zim discloses the mechanism of claim 24, wherein said status
indicator displays one, or a plurality of arrow display elements to indicate the transfer of
data from said client application to said server during said session, and the presence of

available session-speciﬁc content at said server (column 6, lines 23-41).

As per claim 30, Zim discloses the system of claim 21 wherein the server object
matches each query received form the client against an in-memory cache, and returns
cached content to the client without accessing said content engine, unless the cached
content has expired since it was last received from said content engine (column 9, liens

1-25).

As per claim 31, Zim discloses the system of claim 21, wherein the server

analyzes the time between said consecutive queries received from each client system,

Application/Control Number: 09/933,493 Page 8
Art Unit: 2157

and skips selected ones of said consecutive queries to reduce network communications

and the load on said content engine (column 9, lines 45-67).

Response to Arguments
(d) Applicant's argument has been considered but is moot in view of the new

ground(s) of rejection.

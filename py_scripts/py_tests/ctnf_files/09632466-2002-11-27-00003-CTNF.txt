DETAILED ACTION

Claim Rejections - 35 USC § 102

1. The following is a quotation of the appropriate paragraphs of 35 U.S.C. 102 that

form the basis for the rejections under this section made in this Office action:

A person shall be entitled to a patent unless —

(e) the invention was described in a patent granted on an application for patent by another ﬁled in the
United States before the invention thereof by the applicant for patent, or on an international application
by another who has fulﬁlled the requirements of paragraphs (1), (2), and (4) of section 371 (c) of this
title before the invention thereof by the applicant for patent.

The changes made to 35 U.S.C. 102(e) by the American Inventors Protection Act
of 1999 (AIPA) do not apply to the examination of this application as the application
being examined was not (1) filed on or after November 29, 2000, or (2) voluntarily
published under 35 U.S.C. 122(b). Therefore, this application is examined under 35
U.S.C. 102(e) prior to the amendment by the AIPA (pre-AIPA 35 U.S.C. 102(e)).

2. Claims 1-5 and 7-10 are rejected under 35 U.S.C. 102(e) as being anticipated
by Garney et at. (US Patent 5,890,015)

a. As per claims 1 and 10, Garney discloses wireless USB hub comprising:

- a data reception circuit for receiving data in a wireless manner from
the one or more remote wireless peripheral devices; (coi.5, lines
30-47), (fig.5, 520)

- an upstream port connected to the computer; (fig.4), (co|.5, lines

18-29)

Application/Control Number: 09/632,466 Page 3
Art Unit: 2189

- a hub controller for passing information from the data reception
circuit to the upstream port for transmission to the computer. (col.5,
lines 18-47), (fig.5, 420)
b. As per claim 2, Garney discloses data reception circuit further includes an RF
receiver for receiving wireless information from at least one of the one or more
remote peripheral devices. (col.2, lines 3-7)
c. As per claims 3 and 7, Garney discloses data reception circuit further includes
a signal discriminator for receiving information from said receiver and presenting
the peripheral device data information to hub controller. (col.5, lines 30-47),
(fig.5, 530) ‘
d. As per claims 4, 8 and 9, Garney discloses hub controller further includes a
serial interface engine for converting the remote peripheral information into usb
format. (col.5,lines 30-47), (co|.6, lines 46-65)
e. As per claim 5, Garney discloses further including three separate data
reception circuits each corresponding to a separate remote peripheral device,

wherein each of data reception circuits include a separate receiver. (col.5, lines

18-47)

Claim Rejections - 35 USC § 103
3. The following is a quotation of 35 U.S.C. 103(a) which forms the basis for ail

obviousness rejections set forth in this Ofﬁce action:

(a) A patent may not be obtained though the invention is not identically disclosed or described as set
forth in section 102 of this title, if the differences between the subject matter sought to be patented and
the prior art are such that the subject matter as a whole would have been obvious at the time the
invention was made to a person having ordinary skill in the art to which said subject matter pertains.
Patentability shall not be negatived by the manner in which the invention was made.

4. Claims 6 and 11 are rejected under 35 U.S.C. 103(a) as being unpatentable over
Garney et al. (US Patent 5,890,015) in view of Applicant Admitted Prior Art (AAPA)

Garney discloses all the limitations as above except Garney fails to disclose RF
receiver is a D888 BPSK modulation receiver as claimed in claims 6 and 11. However,
AAPA discloses a D888 BPSK modulation receiver. (page 9, lines 11-21)

It would have been obvious one having ordinary skills in the art at the time the
invention was made to incorporate AAPA’s teaching into Garney’s method to have the
D888 BPSK modulation receiver so as to safe time for configuration of data for
transmitting on the USB and so as to be compatible with advancements in wireless

communication System.

computer system. (col.13, lines 42-56)

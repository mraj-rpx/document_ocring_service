B1).

As per claims 1, 24, 29, 32-33, Yano discloses a system, user interface
mechanism, and method of providing session-based retrieval and at a client system of ,
string-based content from a server cemprising:

. ' - A communication protocol that enables connection over a network between a
client system and a server system, and allows the client system to send via the
network, and within a'single session between the client system and the server
system, a lengthening string corhposed of a plurality of consecutively input
characters, to querythe‘server system for stringebased content (paragraphs [0032-
0033,0039,0042D;

. - A client object, in communication with a client software at the client system and
with the communication pretocoL wherein the client object receives additional
characters from the client software, and as consecutive characters are being
received, transmits via the network to a server object at the server system a plurality
of consecutive queries, within the same session, to retrieve content from the server

system, wherein each consecutive lengthens the query string by additional

Application/Control Number: 09/933,493 . ‘ Page 5
Art Unit: 2157

characters, to form a lengthening string for retrieving matching conteht from the
server system (paragraphs [0053, 0077, 0093, 01171);

5 A server object, in Communication with the server system, and with the Client
object via the communication protocol, wherein the server object in response ta
receiving the consecutive queries that form the lengthening string, automatically
uses the lengthening string to query and retrieve content information from the server .
system that matches the lengthening string, and wherein the server object returns,
while the additional characters are being input and the string is being lengthened

during the session, increasingly matching content infOrmation to the client object for

immediate use by the alient system (paragraphs [0035, 0045, 00611).

Yano does not explicitly disclose:

A communication protocol that enables an asynchronous session based connection
between a client system anda server system;

Asy’hch'ronously returns increasingly relevant content information to the client object
for immediate use by the client system;

receiving an asynchronous response from the server as the characters are being

input

However, like-Yano, Gersh teaches users transmitting queries to a Web'server to find

information from various Web suppliers. Asynchronous messaging is provided between

the client (user) and server (Web server) (column 48, lines 14-17, 40-53).

Therefore, one or ordinary skill in the art at the time the invention was made

would have found itobvious to incorporate or implement Gersh’s asynchronous session

Application/Control Number: 09/933,493 Page 6
Art Unit: 2157 '

and asynchronously returning relevant content in Yano’s system providing updates to

the client such as content and- database rep|ication.

As per claim 2, Yano discloses the system of claim 1 wherein said client object operates
on or at a first computer and said server object operates on or at a second computer
and wherein both of said first and said second computers are connected via a network

protocol (paragraphs [0033-0035]).

As per claim 3, Yano discloses the system of claim 1 wherein said server object and

said client object runs on the same computer (paragraph [0037]).

As per claim 4, Yano discloses the system of claim 1 wherein said server Object runs
‘ on a plurality of separate computers, and wherein said client queries received during the»

session are distributed over said separate computers (paragraph [0070]).

As per claim 5, Yano discloses the system of claim 1 wherein said sewer object
store's previously received strings and returns said stored strings to the client in
response to new client queries received during the session, without accessing said

content (paragraph [0042, 0058]).

As per'claim 6, Yanofurther discloses the system of claim 1 wherein said client

software is embedded into a software applicationthat provides a visual interface to an

Application/Controi Number: 09/933;493, ' A Page 7
Art Unit: 2157 '

operator that the server object is currently using the lengthening query string against the
content of the server system to query and retrieve content information from the sewer
system-and allows the operator to add additional characters to lengthen the query
string, while simultaneously receiving increasingly matching results from the server

(paragraph [0053, 0065, 00771).

As per claim 7, Yano discloses the system of claim 1 wherein said client software is

used as a content engine for another software system (paragraph [0057]).'

As per claim 8, Yano discloses the system of claim 1 wherein said client software
accumulates a plurality of said single character queries as they are entered into the
, client, before sending them together as a single query string to said server (paragraph

[0057]).'

As per claim 9, Yano discloses the system of claim 1 wherein said client software
stores previously received responses from the server in a cache at the client and uses
the previously received responses as the response to a new query by the user, without

reassessing the server (paragraph [0065]).

As per claim 10, Yano discloses the system of claim 1 wherein said client

software stores a pre-defined string and automatically transmits it to the server as the

Application/Control Number: 09/933,493‘ , ' Page 8
Art Unit: 2157

client software is first accessed, and wherein additional entry of query characters is not

required before server responses are sent to the client (paragraph [0075, 0093]).

As per claim 11, Yano discloses the system of claim 1 wherein said server stores the
state of (query and response of the client software, and restores the state of the client

software after any interruption in said communication protocol (paragraph [0084]).

As per claim 12, Yano discloses the system of claim 1 where said client software
adds a qualifier to the query that is passed to the server, whereby the server can use
said qualifier to execute the query and return appropriate results based on both the

, query string and its qualifier (paragraph [0069]). _

As per claim 13, Yano discloses the system of claim 1 where said client Software
identifies a user of the system to the server whereby the server can store statistics and
provides a history of queries and corresponding responses appropriate to said user

(paragraph [0125, O141]).

As per claim 14, Yano disc|oses the system of claim 1 where said server system
comprises a server tier and a syndication tier, and wherein said client software
communicates to the server tier on a single computer, and wherein each query is

forwarded by the server tier and the syndication tier to an appropriate syndicate of

Application/Control Number: 09/933,493 ' Page 9
Art Unit: 2157 ' -

content channels connected to the server tier on a different computer (paragraph

[0137D-

As per Claim 15, Yano discloses the system of claim 1 where said server applies a
content dependent pattern and ﬁlter to characters received from the client before

queries are matched against the content (paragraph [0050,_ 0065]).

As per claim 17, Yano further discloses the system of claim 1 where server
responses comprise lists of strings, wherein each string is accompanied by
corresponding metadata, whereby the metadata contains logical links to other data

sources of Uniform Resource Identifiers (paragraph [0088]).

As per claim 25, Yano discloses the mechanism of claim 24, wherein said user -

interface element is an application input field (paragraph [0073]).

As per claim 26, Yano discloses the mechanism of claim 24, wherein said session
indicator displays a triangular display element to indicate the presence of said session,
and does not display said triangular display element to indicate the absence of said

session (paragraph [0077]).

As per claim 27, Yano discloses the mechanism of claim 24, wherein said status

indicator displays one, or a plurality of arrow display elements to indicate the transfer of

Application/Control Number: 09/933,493 Page 10
Art Unit: 2157 '

data from said client application to said server during said Session, and the presence of

available session-specific content at said server (paragraph [0095]).

As per claim 30, Yano discloses the method of claiin 29 wherein the server
object matches each query received form the client against an in-memory cache, and
returns'cached content to the client without accessing said eentent engine, unless the '
ceched content has expired since it was Ilast received from said content engine

(paragraph [O105]).

As per claim 31, Yano discloses the method of claim 29, wherein the server
analyzes the time- between said consecutive queries received from each client system, '
and skips selected ones of said consecutive queries to reduce network communications

and the load on said content engine (paragraph [0075]).

As per claim 34,- Yano discloses the system of claim 1, whereby the client
object indicates the selection of the contentsources to be queried to the server
when said session is initiated and when content source selection changes are
needed thereafter, without needing to embed said content source selection with

each of said consecutive string-based queries (paragraph [0095]).

As per claim 35, Yano discloses the system of claim 1 whereby said session

is shared by multipIe-client objects that exchange messages with the same server

Applicatien/Control Number: 09/933,493 Page 11
Art Unit: 2157

system, whereby each client object identifies a different content source selection to
which said consecutive queries from the individual client object will be mapped by

its Correspondingserver object (paragraph [0135]).

As per siaims 36737, Yano discloses a system and_method for providing session-
based searching of string-based content from aserver, comptising:

‘oi a uservinterface at a plurality of clients that allows a Iuser at each of the plurality of

‘ clients to entera string of consecutively input queries to qLiery the server -for
string-based content, wherein each consecutive query lengthens the query
string by' one or more additional sharacters (paragraphs [0053, 0077, 0093, 01171);

0 a communication protocol that transmits over a network, via a client object at each
said client, to a server object at the server, the plurality of consecutive queries, to
retrieve cohtent from the server, wherein each additional character is immediateiy
transmitted to the server object as the user“ is entering the {additional
characters in thevuser interface, to form an lengthening query string for retrieving
content from the server (paragraphs [0032-0033, 0039, 0042]);

. aserver' object which in responsesto receiving each query as it is being
lengthened or‘shortened by the one or more additional characters, automatically
matches the lengthening query string against the content of the server, and, as
the user of a particular client is entering' queries, modifies the user interface by,

' returning increasingly relevant server content information to the client objectsfor

immediate display to the user (paragraphs [0035, 0045, 00611).

in-fo-rmation' from various Web suppliers. Asynchronous messaging is provided between
the client (user) and server (Web server) (columnu48, lines 14-17, 40-53).
Therefore, one or ordinary skill. in the art at the time the intention was made

would have found it obvio‘us to incorporate or implement Gersh’s asynchronous session
“and asynchronously returning relevant content in Yano’s system providing updates to

I the client such as content and database replication.

_ As per claim 38, Yano discloses the system of claim 1 wherein the client software is

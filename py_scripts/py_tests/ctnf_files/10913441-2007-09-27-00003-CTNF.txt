18. Patent and Trademark Ofﬁce
PTOL-326 (Rev. 08-06) ' Ofﬁce Action Summary Part of Paper No./Mai| Date 20070917

Applikcation/Control Number: 10/913,441 Page 2
Art Unit: 2823

The following is a quotation of the appropriate paragraphs of 35 U.S.C. 102 that form the

basis for the rejections under this section made in this Ofﬁce action:

A person shall be entitled to a patent unless —

(b) the invention was patented or described in a printed publication in this or a foreign country or in public use or on
sale in this country, more than one year prior to the date of application for patent in the United States.

Claims 138 and 148 are rejected under 35 U.S.C. 102(b) as being anticipated by Ogawa
et al (U S. Patent 5,437,894).

Ogawa et al discloses a bonding method, comprising ﬁrst and second materials having
ﬁrst and second bonding surfaces, respectively, enhancing activation and etching said ﬁrst and
second bonding surfaces, bringing into direct contact said ﬁrst and second bonding surfaces after
said etching step, terminating said ﬁrst and second bonding surfaces with a species allowing

formation of chemical bond (Column 9, lines 55-65, and Column 31, lines 53-67).

Claims 139-141, and 149-151, are rejected under 35 U.S.C. 103(a) as being unpatentable
over Ogawa et al as applied to claims 138 and 148 above, and further in view of the following
comments.

Ogawa et al discloses the claimed invention except for forming a bond between said ﬁrst
and second bonding surfaces at room temperature with a strength of at least 500 mJ/mz, 1000
mJ/mz, and 2000 mJ/mz. It would have been obvious to one having ordinary skill in the art at the
time the invention was made to determine a suitable bond strength between the ﬁrst and second
bonding surfaces, since it has been held that whete the general conditions of a claim are

disclosed in the prior art, discovering the optimam or workable ranges involves only routine skill

in the art. In re Aller, 105 USPQ 233.

Application/Control Number: 10/913 ,441 ' Page 3
Art Unit: 2823

In addition, the selection of a suitable bond strength, it’s obvious because it is a matter of
determining optimum process conditions by routine experimentation with a limited number of
species of result effective variables. These claims are prima facie obvious without showing that
the claimed ranges achieve unexpected results relative to theprior art range. In re Woodruff, 16
USPQ2d 1935, 1937 (Fed. Cir. 1990). See also In re Huang, 40 USPQ2d 1685, 1688 (Fed. Cir.
1996)(claimed ranges or a result effective variable, which do not overlap the prior art ranges, are
unpatentable unless they produce a new and unexpected result which is different in kind and not ‘
merely in degree from the results of the prior art). See also In re Boesch, 205 USPQ 215
(CCPA) (discovery of optimum value of result effective variable in known process is ordinarily
within skill or art) and In re Aller, 105 USPQ 233 (CCPA 1995) (selection of optimum ranges
within prior art general conditions is obvious).

Note that the speciﬁcation contains no disclosure of either the critical nature of the
claimed bond strengths or any unexpected results arising therefrom. Where patentability is said
to be based _upon particular chosen bond strengths or upon another variable recited in a claim, the
Applicant must show that the chosen bond strengths are critical. In re Woodrut, 919 F.2d 1575,

1578, 16 USPQ2d 1934, 1936 (Fed. Cir. 1990).

Claims 142-147, and 152-157, and are objected to as being dependent upon a rejected
base claim, but would be allowable if rewritten in independent form including all of the

limitations of the base claim and any intervening claims.

Claims 158-236 are allowed.

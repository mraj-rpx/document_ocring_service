DETAILED ACTION
Claim Rejections - 35 USC § 102
1. The following is a quotation of the appropriate paragraphs of 35
U.S.C. 102 that form the basis for the rejections under this section made in this

Office action:

A person shall be entitled to a patent unless —

(e) the invention was described in (1) an application for patent, published under section
122(b), by another ﬁled in the United States before the invention by the applicant for patent or
(2) a patent granted on an application for patent by another ﬁled in the United States before
the invention by the applicant for patent, except that an international application ﬁled under
the treaty deﬁned in section 351(a) shall have the effects for purposes of this subsection of an
application ﬁled in the United States only if the international application designated the United
States and was published under Article 21(2) of such treaty in the English language.

2. Claims 1 and ‘10 are rejected under 35 U.S.C. 102(e) as being anticipated
by Mizutan et al. (Pub No. :US 2003/0043771 A1)
a. As per claims 1 and 10, Mizutan discloses wireless USB hub
comprising:
= a data reception circuit for receiving data in a wireless
manner from the one or more remote wireless peripheral
devices; (see abstract and [0014], wherein wireless hub
perform communication with computer and devices, converts
to a USB package routed to device and vice versa,
transceiver transmit and receive data from devices)
- an upstream port connected to the computer; ([0116],
wherein upstream to computer and downstream to device)
- a hub controller for passing information from the data

reception circuit to the upstream port for transmission to the

computer. ([0116], wherein upstream to computer and
downstream to device)
Claim Rejections - 35 USC § 103
3. The following is a quotation of 35 U.S.C. 103(a) which forms the basis for

all obviousness rejections set forth in this Office action:

(a) A patent may not be obtained though the invention is not identically disclosed or described
as set forth in section 102 of this title, if the differences between the subject matter sought to
be patented and the prior art are such that the subject matter as a whole would have been
obvious at the time the invention was made to a person having ordinary skill in the art to which
said subject matter pertains. Patentability shall not be negatived by the manner in which the
invention was made.

Claims 2-9, 11 are rejected under 35 U.S.C. 103(a) as being
unpatentable over Mizutani et al. (Pub. No.: US 2003/0043771 A1)

a. As per claim 2, Mizutani discloses data reception circuit further includes

receiver (fig.1, 21) for receiving wireless information from at least one of

the one or more remote peripheral devices. [0047]

Although Mizutani fails to disclose RF receiver for receiving
wireless information. Mizutani does teach transceiver(ﬁg.1,21)

Examiner take Ofﬁcial Notice that RF receiver and transceiver are
well known in' the art for providing a means of receiving wireless
information.

It would have been obvious one having ordinary skills in the art at
the time the invention was made to have RF receiver or transceiver with
the same purpose of receiving wireless information.

b. As per claim 3 , Mizutani discloses data reception circuit further

includes a signal discriminator for receiving information from said receiver

Application/CejrolNum r:09/632,466 . A Page4
Art Unit: 2189

and presenting the peripheral device data information to hub controller.
([0047], [0020],[OO14], wherein a hub and port each have a device
identiﬁer uniquely assigned)

0. As per claim 5, Mizutani discloses further including three separate data
reception circuits each corresponding to a separate remote peripheral
device, wherein each of data reception circuits include a separate
receiver. ([0015], (fig.1,23 transceiver, wherein a hub is controlling each
port has a device identifier assigned to them which implies separation of
data reception)

Although Mizutani discloses limitations as above showing each

corresponding to a separate remote peripheral. However Mizutani fails to
discloses three separate data reception circuits It would have been
obvious to one having ordinary skill in the art at the time the invention was
made to have the additions of 2"‘j and 3rd circuits since it has been held
that mere duplication of the essential working parts of a device involves
only routine skill in the art.
d. Claims 6 and 11, Mizutani discloses all the limitations as above except
RF receiver is a DSSS BPSK modulation receiver as claimed in claims 6
and 11. However, Applicant Admitted Prior Art RF receiver is conventional
DSSS BPSK modulation receiver which is well known in the art. (page 10,
lines 9-10)

It would have been obvious one having ordinary skills in the art at

the time the invention was made to have DSSS BPSK modulation receiver

Application/Control Numge209/632,466 . Page 5
Art Unit: 2189

with the same purposeof modulating signals to correlated signal for
communicating between devices.

0. As per claim 3 , Mizutani discloses data reception circuit further
includes a signal discriminator for receiving information from said receiver
and presenting the peripheral device data information to hub controller.
([0047], [0020],[0014], wherein a hub and port each have a device
identifier uniquely assigned)

e. As per claims 4, 8 and 9, Mizutani discloses hub controller further
includes a serial interface engine (ﬁg.1, 15) for converting the remote

peripheral information into USB format. [0015]

Response to Arguments
4. Applicant's arguments with respect to claims 1-11 have been considered
but are moot ih view of the new ground(s) of rejection.

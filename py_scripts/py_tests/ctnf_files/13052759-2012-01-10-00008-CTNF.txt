DETAILED ACTION
Double Patenting

1. The nonstatutory double patenting rejection is based on a judicially created
doctrine grounded in public policy (a policy reflected in the statute) so as to prevent the
unjustified or improper timewise extension of the “right to exclude” granted by a patent
and to prevent possible harassment by multiple assignees. A nonstatutory
obviousness-type double patenting rejection is appropriate where the conflicting claims
are not identical, but at least one examined application claim is not patentably distinct
from the reference claim(s) because the examined application claim is either anticipated
by, or would have been obvious over, the reference claim(s). See, e.g., In re Berg, 140
F.3d 1428, 46 USPQ2d 1226 (Fed. Cir. 1998); In re Goodman, 11 F.3d 1046, 29
USPQe2d 2010 (Fed. Cir. 1993); In re Longi, 759 F.2d 887, 225 USPQ 645 (Fed. Cir.
1985); In re Van Ornum, 686 F.2d 937, 214 USPQ 761 (CCPA 1982); In re Vogel, 422
F.2d 438, 164 USPQ 619 (CCPA 1970); and /n re Thorington, 418 F.2d 528, 163
USPQ 644 (CCPA 1969).

A timely filed terminal disclaimer in compliance with 37 CFR 1.321(c) or 1.321 (d)
may be used to overcome an actual or provisional rejection based on a nonstatutory
double patenting ground provided the conflicting application or patent either is shown to
be commonly owned with this application, or claims an invention made as a result of

activities undertaken within the scope of a joint research agreement.

Application/Control Number: 13/052,759 Page 3
Art Unit: 3732

Effective January 1, 1994, aregistered attorney or agent of record may sign a
terminal disclaimer. A terminal disclaimer signed by the assignee must fully comply with
37 CFR 3.73(b).

2. Claims 1, 3-5 and 9-15 are rejected on the ground of nonstatutory obviousness-
type double patenting as being unpatentable over claims 1, 4-7 and 10-12 of U.S.
Patent No. 7909603. Although the conflicting claims are not identical, they are not
patentably distinct from each other because

BD: The claims of the parent “anticipate” the claims of the application. Accordingly,
the application claims are not patentably distinct from the patent claims. Here, the more
specific patent claims encompass the broader application claim. Following the rationale
in In re Goodman cited in the proceeding paragraph, where applicant has once been
granted a patent containing a claim for the specific or narrower invention, applicant may
not then obtain a second patent with a claim for the generic or broader invention without

first submitting an appropriate terminal disclaimer.

Claim Rejections - 35 USC § 112

4. The following is a quotation of the second paragraph of 35 U.S.C. 112:

The specification shall conclude with one or more claims particularly pointing out and distinctly
claiming the subject matter which the applicant regards as his invention.

5. Claim 19 is rejected under 35 U.S.C. 112, second paragraph, as being indefinite
for failing to particularly point out and distinctly claim the subject matter which applicant

regards as the invention.

Application/Control Number: 13/052,759 Page 4
Art Unit: 3732

6. Claim 19 recites the limitation "the base surface of the ligating member" in the

body of the claim. There is insufficient antecedent basis for this limitation in the claim.

Claim Rejections - 35 USC § 102
7. The following is a quotation of the appropriate paragraphs of 35 U.S.C. 102 that

form the basis for the rejections under this section made in this Office action:

A person shall be entitled to a patent unless —

(b) the invention was patented or described in a printed publication in this or a foreign country or in
public use or on sale in this country, more than one year prior to the date of application for patent in
the United States.

8. Claims 1, 2, 5-7 and 9 are rejected under 35 U.S.C. 102(b) as being anticipated
by Orikasa (US 20020119414 A1).

9. Regarding claims 1 and 5, Orikasa discloses a self-ligating orthodontic bracket
for coupling an archwire with a tooth, comprising: a bracket body 102 (figure 14B)
configured to be mounted to the tooth, the bracket body including a support surface
(see “support surface” in figure 14B below) and an archwire slot 103 with opposing first
and second slot surfaces (see "opposing surfaces” in figure 14B below) extending away
from a base surface (see "base surface” in figure 14B below), the support surface being
acutely angled with respect to the base surface; and a movable member 105 coupled
with the bracket body and movable between an opened position in which the archwire is
insertable into the archwire slot and a closed position in which the movable member
retains the archwire in the archwire slot, wherein the movable member comprises a first
portion (near element 106 in figure 14B) and a second portion (near element 105 in

figure 14B) extending from the first portion and being acutely angled with respect to the

Application/Control Number: 13/052,759 Page 5
Art Unit: 3732

first portion, the first portion engaging the acutely angled support surface (capable of
engaging the support surface when a smaller archwire is used) of the bracket body
when the movable member is in the closed position, the second portion being generally
parallel to the base surface and extending across the archwire slot from the first slot
surface to the second slot surface in a direction generally transverse (Merriam-Webster
defines transverse as "acting, lying, or being across; set crosswise”) when the movable
member is in the closed position (as seen in figure 14B; second portion would extend
even farther past the far side opposing surface when a smaller archwire is used) and
wherein the second portion is generally parallel to the base surface during sliding
movement of the movable member from the closed position toward the opened position
(during at least a portion of the sliding movement). Re. claim 2, the bracket body
includes a ledge (portion of "base surface" closest to "opposing sides" in figure 14B
below) extending in the mesial-distal direction and being separated from the support
surface by the archwire slot 103, the second portion (near element 105 in figure 14B) of
the movable member 105 cooperating with the ledge (capable of touching/cooperating
with ledge if smaller archwire is used) when the movable member is in the closed
position). Re. claim 6, the movable member further includes an occlusal-gingival
extending groove (not labeled in figure 14A; labeled as 16D in figure 1 and 2A; groove
on underside of movable member) defining at least one end that limits movement of the

movable member in at least one direction (as seen in figure 2A).

10. Claims 1, 2, 5-13 and 16-19 are rejected under 35 U.S.C. 102(b) as being
anticipated by Christoff et al (US 6071119).

11. | Regarding claims 1 and 5, Christoff discloses a self-ligating orthodontic bracket
for coupling an archwire with a tooth, comprising: a bracket body 24 (figures 3-5)
configured to be mounted to the tooth, the bracket body including a support surface
(portion of body to left of element number 42 in figure 5) and an archwire slot 30 with
opposing first and second slot surfaces (to left and right in figures 3-5) extending away
from a base surface (surface element 34 rests on in figure 4), the support surface being
acutely angled with respect to the base surface; and a movable member 32 coupled
with the bracket body and movable between an opened position (figure 5) in which the
archwire is insertable into the archwire slot and a closed position (figures 3 and 4) in
which the movable member retains the archwire in the archwire slot, wherein the

movable member comprises a first portion 36 and a second portion 34 extending from

Application/Control Number: 13/052,759 Page 7
Art Unit: 3732

the first portion and being acutely angled with respect to the first portion (figures 3 and
4), the first portion 36 engaging the acutely angled support surface of the bracket body
when the movable member is in the closed position (figures 3 and 4), the second
portion 34 being generally parallel to the base surface (parallel to base surface of slot in
figure 3 and parallel to base surface as set forth above in figure 4) and extending across
the archwire slot from the first slot surface to the second slot surface in a direction
generally transverse (Merriam-Webster defines transverse as "acting, lying, or being
across; set crosswise”) when the movable member is in the closed position and wherein
the second portion is generally parallel to the base surface during sliding movement of
the movable member from the closed position toward the opened position (during at
least a portion of the sliding movement).

12. Regarding claim 10, 16 and 19, as best understood by the Examiner, Christoff
discloses a method of using an orthodontic bracket mounted to a tooth surrounded by
gingiva, the orthodontic bracket including a bracket body 24 having an archwire slot 40
with a base surface (bottom of slot) generally defining a base plane, a generally planar
support surface (portion of body to left of element number 42 in figure 5) acutely angled
relative to the base surface, and a ligating member 32 movably mounted to the bracket
body, wherein the ligating member comprises a first portion 36 and a second portion 34
extending from the first portion and being acutely angled with respect to the first portion,
the first portion engaging the acutely angled support surface of the bracket body, the
method comprising: moving the ligating member relative to the base plane to an opened

position (figure 5; Col. 7, lines 8-10), the archwire slot being accessible when the

Application/Control Number: 13/052,759 Page 8
Art Unit: 3732

ligating member is in the opened position; inserting an archwire into the archwire slot
(Col. 7, lines 10-14: “enable... insertion of an archwire”); and moving the ligating
member relative to the base plane to a closed position (figure 4) such that the ligating
member engages the acutely angled support surface in the closed position, the archwire
being retained in the archwire slot when the ligating member is in the closed position,
wherein during sliding of the ligating member (sliding along element 46), the first portion
36 is in contact with the acutely angled support surface while the second portion 3
remains generally parallel to the base surface (during sliding along element 46).

13. Alternatively, regarding claims 10 and 19, as best understood by the Examiner,
Christoff discloses a method of using an orthodontic bracket mounted to a tooth
surrounded by gingiva, the orthodontic bracket including a bracket body 24 having an
archwire slot 40 with a base surface (bottom of slot) generally defining a base plane, a
generally planar support surface (portion to left of element 46 in figure 3-5. also seen as
portion element 34 rests on in figure 4) acutely angled relative to the base surface, and
a ligating member 32 movably mounted to the bracket body, wherein the ligating
member comprises a first portion (near element 34 in figure 3) and a second portion (to
left of element 34 in figure 3) extending from the first portion and being acutely angled
with respect to the first portion, the method comprising: moving the ligating member
relative to the base plane to an opened position (figure 5; Col. 7, lines 8-10), the
archwire slot being accessible when the ligating member is in the opened position;
inserting an archwire into the archwire slot (Col. 7, lines 10-14: “enable... insertion of an

archwire”); and moving the ligating member relative to the base plane to a closed

Application/Control Number: 13/052,759 Page 9
Art Unit: 3732

position (figure 4) such that the ligating member engages the acutely angled support
surface in the closed position, the archwire being retained in the archwire slot when the
ligating member is in the closed position, wherein during sliding of the ligating member,
the first portion, the first portion is in contact with the acutely angled support surface
while the second portion remains generally parallel to the base surface of the ligating

member.

Claim Rejections - 35 USC § 103
14. — The following is a quotation of 35 U.S.C. 103(a) which forms the basis for all

obviousness rejections set forth in this Office action:

(a) A patent may not be obtained though the invention is not identically disclosed or described as set
forth in section 102 of this title, if the differences between the subject matter sought to be patented and
the prior art are such that the subject matter as a whole would have been obvious at the time the
invention was made to a person having ordinary skill in the art to which said subject matter pertains.
Patentability shall not be negatived by the manner in which the invention was made.

15. Claims 3, 4, 14 and 15 are rejected under 35 U.S.C. 103(a) as being
unpatentable over Christof.

16. Regarding claims 3 and 4, Christoff discloses the claimed invention substantially
as Claimed, as set forth above for claim 1. Christoff is silent regarding said support
surface is angled approximately 20 degrees with respect to said base surface. The
angle of the support surface relative to the base surface is a result effective variable,
wherein the angle affects the level and type of force on the archwire. It would have
been obvious to one having ordinary skill in the art at the time the invention was made
to make the angle of the support surface relative to the base surface approximately 20

degrees since it has been held that discovering an optimum value of a result effective

Application/Control Number: 13/052,759 Page 10
Art Unit: 3732

variable involves only routine skill in the art. In re Boesch, 617 F.2d 272, 205 USPQ
215 (CCPA 1980).

17. Regarding claim 14, Christoff discloses the claimed invention substantially as
claimed, as set forth above for claim 10. Christoff is silent regarding the retaining pin 42
projecting from the bracket body and the retaining slot being in the ligating member.
However it would have been obvious to one having ordinary skill in the art at the time
the invention was made to reverse the slots and the retaining pin, such that a retaining
pin is placed where the slots are in the bracket body and a slot is placed where the
retaining pin is in the ligating member, for the purpose of providing means to secure the
ligating member to the bracket body in a number of predetermined locations, since it
has been held that a mere reversal of the essential working parts of a device involves
only routine skill in the art. In re Einstein, 8 USPQ 167.

18. | Regarding claim 15, Christoff is further silent regarding the projecting portion
including a retaining ball and the receiving portion being a retaining groove for receiving
the ball. However, it would have been an obvious matter of design choice to change the
shape of the pin 42 and grooves 48/50 such that the projection(s) is a retaining ball and
the receiving portion(s) is a groove for receiving the ball, for the purpose of providing
objects which effectively engage each other so as to effectively lock the ligating member
to the bracket body in a plurality of predetermined locations, since such a modification
would have involved a mere change in the form or shape of a component. A change in
form or shape is generally recognized as being within the level of ordinary skill in the art.

In re Dailey, 149 USPQ 47 (CCPA 1976).

Application/Control Number: 13/052,759 Page 11
Art Unit: 3732

19. Claims 3, 4, 6 and 7 are rejected under 35 U.S.C. 103(a) as being unpatentable
over Orikasa.

20. Regarding claims 3 and 4, Orikasa discloses the claimed invention substantially
as Claimed, as set forth above for claim 1. Orikasa is silent regarding said support
surface is angled approximately 20 degrees with respect to said base surface. The
angle of the support surface relative to the base surface is a result effective variable,
wherein the angle affects the level and type of force on the archwire. It would have
been obvious to one having ordinary skill in the art at the time the invention was made
to make the angle of the support surface relative to the base surface approximately 20
degrees since it has been held that discovering an optimum value of a result effective
variable involves only routine skill in the art. In re Boesch, 617 F.2d 272, 205 USPQ
215 (CCPA 1980).

21. Regarding claims 6 and 7, Orikasa discloses the claimed invention as claimed,
as set forth above for claims 6 and 7. Assuming, arguendo, that the embodiment in
figures 14A-B of Orikasa is silent regarding the movable member further includes an
occlusal-gingival extending groove defining at least one end that limits movement of the
movable member in at least one direction, an alternative embodiment disclosed by
Orikasa teaches the movable member further includes an occlusal-gingival extending
groove (not labeled in figure 14A; labeled as 16D in figure 1 and 2A; groove on
underside of movable member) defining at least one end that limits movement of the

movable member in at least one direction (as seen in figure 2A). Therefore, it would

Application/Control Number: 13/052,759 Page 12
Art Unit: 3732

have been obvious to one of ordinary skill in the art, at the time the invention was made,
to modify the Orikasa embodiment in figures 14A-B by providing an occlusal-gingival
extending groove defining at least one end that limits movement of the movable

member in at least one direction, as taught by the Orikasa embodiment of figures 1 and
2A, for the purpose of preventing the accidental detachment of the movable member

from the body.

22. Claims 6-8 are rejected under 35 U.S.C. 103(a) as being unpatentable over
Orikasa and in view of Christof.

23. Regarding claims 6-8, Orikasa discloses the claimed invention substantially as
claimed, as set forth above for claim 1. Orikasa is silent regarding the movable member
including an occlusal-gingival extending groove defining at least one end that limits
movement of the movable member in at least one direction and the at least one end
defining a projection that abuts the bracket body when the movable member is in the
closed position. However, Christoff discloses a movable member 32 (figures 3-5)
including an occlusal-gingival extending groove (groove between portion of movable
member near element 32 in figure 3 and inner portion of element 42) defining at least
one end 42 that limits movement of the movable member in at least one direction (see
figure 5) and the at least one end defining a projection that abuts the bracket body (at
element 48) when the movable member is in the closed position (see figure 4).
Therefore, it would have been obvious to one of ordinary skill in the art, at the time the

invention was made, to modify Orikasa by providing an occlusal-gingival extending

Application/Control Number: 13/052,759 Page 13
Art Unit: 3732

groove defining at least one end that limits movement of the movable member in at
least one direction and the at least one end defining a projection that abuts the bracket
body when the movable member is in the closed position, as taught by Christoff, for the
purpose of allowing the movable member to be fixed in multiple predetermined positions
relative to the bracket body. The projection 42 taught by Christoff lies in the plane of the

first portion (a plane as shown in figure 3-5).

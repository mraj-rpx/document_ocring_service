DETAILED ACTION

Double Patenting

1. The nonstatutory double patenting rejection is based on a judicially created
doctrine grounded in public policy (a policy reflected in the statute) so as to prevent the
unjustified or improper timewise extension of the “right to exclude” granted by a patent
and to prevent possible harassment by multiple assignees. A nonstatutory
obviousness-type double patenting rejection is appropriate where the conﬂicting claims
are not identical, but at least one examined application claim is not patentably distinct
from the reference claim(s) because the examined application claim is either anticipated
by, or would have been obvious over, the reference claim(s). See, e.g., In re Berg, 140
F.3d 1428, 46 USPQ2d 1226 (Fed. Cir. 1998); In re Goodman, 11 F.3d 1046, 29
USPQ2d 2010 (Fed. Cir. 1993); In re Longi, 759 F.2d 887, 225 USPQ 645 (Fed. Cir.
1985); In re Van Ornum, 686 F.2d 937, 214 USPQ 761 (CCPA 1982); In re Vogel, 422
F.2d 438, 164 USPQ 619 (CCPA 1970); and In re Thorington, 418 F.2d 528, 163
USPQ 644 (CCPA 1969).

A timely filed terminal disclaimer in compliance with 37 CFR 1.321(c) or 1 .321(d)
may be used to overcome an actual or provisional rejection based on a nonstatutory
double patenting ground provided the conflicting application or patent either is shown to
be commonly owned with this application, or claims an invention made as a result of
activities undertaken within the scope of a joint research agreement.

Effective January 1, 1994, a registered attorney or agent of record may sign a
terminal disclaimer. A terminal disclaimer signed by the assignee must fully comply with
37 CFR 3.73(b).

2. Claims 54, 56- are rejected on the ground of nonstatutory obviousness-type

double patenting as being unpatentable over claims 1, 3, 4, 9, 11, 13, 16, 18, 22-25, 27-
29, 36, 38 and 39 of US. Patent No. 7,456,872. Although the conflicting claims are not
identical, they are not patentably distinct from each other because the all of the
limitations of the identified claims in the application are contained in the claims of the

patent.

Claim Rejections - 35 USC § 103

Application/Control Number: 12/290,258 Page 3
Art Unit: 2622

3. The following is a quotation of 35 U.S.C. 103(a) which forms the basis for all

obviousness rejections set forth in this Office action:

(a) A patent may not be obtained though the invention is not identically disclosed or described as set
forth in section 102 of this title, if the differences between the subject matter sought to be patented and
the prior art are such that the subject matter as a whole would have been obvious at the time the
invention was made to a person having ordinary skill in the art to which said subject matter pertains.
Patentability shall not be negatived by the manner in which the invention was made.

4. Claims 54-57, 58, 60, 67, 72 and 73 are rejected under 35 U.S.C. 103(a) as
being unpatentable over US 2005/0036656 (Takahashi) in view of US 6,282,362

(Murphy).

5. As to claim 54, Takahashi teaches an image verification device comprising:

a user verification module 7 for verifying an identity of a user of the device,
wherein upon verification, the user verification module enables operation of the device
(Figs. 1 and 7, when the user is verified the camera is enabled);

a capture module for capturing at least one image and creating a digital image
file, wherein the user verification module verifies the identity of the user of the device at
a time of the image capture (Fig. 7);

a processing module 1 for associating the user identity to the digital image file
(Fig. 7, [0023] and [0077]); and

an encryption module 1 for encrypting the digital image file and associated
information upon image capture (the Examiner considers watermarking and copyright
insertion to be encryption of the associated information and the digital image, [0077]).

What Takahashi does not teach is a locational information module for

determining a location when capturing the image and associating the location

Application/Control Number: 12/290,258 Page 4
Art Unit: 2622

information with the captured image. However, Murphy teaches a camera that has a
locational information module 110 that determines a location when capturing image data
and a processing module 140 that associates the locational information with the
captured image (Fig. 1 and 09 L62-67). Murphy also discusses encrypting the image
data and associated data for authentication (C6 L56-62). Therefore it would have been
obvious to one of ordinary skill in the art at the time the invention was made to have
incorporated a locational information module into the device taught by Takahashi as this
would allow for the position of a captured image to be known without the user having to
remember the location of every image that they take. It further would have been obvious
to have encrypted the location information so that it could not be tampered with by a

third party.

6. As to claim 55, see the rejection of claim 54 and note that Takahashi further
teaches the device as in claim 54, wherein the at least one image is multiple images
processed in at least one video format (Note that Takahashi teaches the device can be

a camera that captures video [0023]).

7. As to claim 56, see the rejection of claim 54 and note that Takahashi further
teaches the device as in claim 54, further comprising a display module 3 for displaying

the captured at least one image ([0056]).

Application/Control Number: 12/290,258 Page 5
Art Unit: 2622

8. As to claim 58, see the rejection of claim 54 and note that Takahashi further
teaches the device as in claim 54, further comprising a storage module 6 for storing at
least one digital image file and the information associated to the digital image file

“0077”.

9. As to claim 60, see the rejection of claim 54 and note that Murphy further teaches
an auxiliary input module for generating auxiliary information related to a captured
image, wherein the auxiliary information is date, time and sequence number (C10 L1-5
and note that the Examiner interprets the time Ti of Murphy to include the date
information). Therefore it would have been obvious to one of ordinary skill in the art at
the time the invention was made to have generated this information as it would be

useful to a user in recalling when the image was captured.

10. Claims 67 and 73 are method claims that are similar to the device claims 54 and

55 respectively and are rejected on similar grounds but directed to a method.

11. As to claim 72, see the rejection of claim 67 and note that Murphy further teaches
transmitting the encrypted information and digital image file to a computing
device;
unencrypting the information and digital image file at the computing device; and

verifying the location and date and time of the image capture (C6 L63 to C7 L25).

Application/Control Number: 12/290,258 Page 6
Art Unit: 2622

12. Claims 57, 61-63, 70 and 71 are rejected under 35 U.S.C. 103(a) as being
unpatentable over US 2005/0036656 (Takahashi) in view of US 6,282,362 (Murphy)
further in view of US 6,642,959 (Arai).

13. As to claim 57, see the rejection of claim 54 and note that neither Takahashi nor
Murphy teach the display module adapted to prompt a user to input information
regarding the captured image. However, Arai teaches a digital camera with a display 12
that is adapted to prompt a user to input information regarding a captured image (Fig.
8). Therefore it would have been obvious to one of ordinary skill in the art at the time the
invention was made to have used the display to prompt a user to input information
regarding a captured image as this is an efficient way to prompt a user to enter

information.

14. As to claim 61, see the rejection of claim 54 and note that neither Takahashi nor
Murphy teach an input module for inputting information regarding the captured image,
and then associating that information with the image file. However, Arai teaches an
input module for inputting information related to a captured image and associating that
information with the image data (Figs. 1, 3, 8 and 9). Therefore it would have been
obvious to one of ordinary skill in the art at the time the invention was made to have
used an input module such as that taught by Arai as this would allow a user to enter
memo at the time of image capture that could remind them about the contents of the

image or why they captured the image or who is in the image which they could not do

Application/Control Number: 12/290,258 Page 7
Art Unit: 2622

with the device taught by the combination of Takahashi and Murphy.

15. As to claim 62, see the rejection of claim 61 and note that Murphy further teaches
that the device creates a separate information file including location information and
inputted information that is linked to the digital information file (through hyperlinks, C10

L1-5).

16. As to claim 63, see the rejection of claim 61 and note that Arai further teaches

that the device appends additional information to the digital image file (Fig. 3).

17. Claims 70 and 71 are method claims that are similar to the device claims 62 and

63 respectively and are rejected on similar grounds but directed to a method.

18. Claims 59, 64, 65 and 68 are rejected under 35 U.S.C. 103(a) as being
unpatentable over US 2005/0036656 (Takahashi) in view of US 6,282,362 (Murphy)
further in view of US 7,006,146 (Tanaka).

19. As to claim 59, what neither Takahashi nor Murphy teach is a transmission
module for transmitting at least one digital image file and its associated information to a
computing device. However, Tanaka teaches a camera 5 coupled to a mobile phone 1
with a communication device 11 that transmits a digital image file to a computing device
(C8 L8-12 and Fig. 2). Therefore it would have been obvious to one of ordinary skill in

the art at the time the invention was made to have used a transmission module to send

Application/Control Number: 12/290,258 Page 8
Art Unit: 2622

images and their associated data to a remote device as this would be very convenient
for a user of the device to be able to send images to a remote location for processing or

viewing by another party.

20. As to claim 64, what neither Takahashi nor Murphy teach is a communication
module coupled to an antenna for wirelessly receiving and transmitting communication
messages. However, Tanaka teaches a camera 5 coupled to a mobile phone 1 with a
communication device 11 that transmits a digital image file to a computing device (08
L8-12 and Fig. 2). Therefore it would have been obvious to one of ordinary skill in the
art at the time the invention was made to have used a transmission module to send
images and their associated data to a remote device as this would be very convenient
for a user of the device to be able to send images to a remote location for processing or

viewing by another party.

21. As to claim 65, see the rejection of claim 64 and note that Takahashi further
teaches a transmission module 11 coupled to the antenna for transmitting as least one
digital image to a computing device (C8 L8-12 and Fig. 2). Therefore it would have been
obvious to one of ordinary skill in the art at the time the invention was made to have
used a transmission module to send images and their associated data to a remote
device as this would be very convenient for a user of the device to be able to send

images to a remote location for processing or viewing by another party.

Application/Control Number: 12/290,258 Page 9
Art Unit: 2622

22. Claim 68 is a method claim that is similar to the device of claim 59 and is rejected

on similar grounds.

23. Claims 66 and 69 are rejected under 35 U.S.C. 103(a) as being unpatentable
over US 2005/0036656 (Takahashi) in view of US 6,282,362 (Murphy) further in
view of US 6,810,323 (Bullock).

24. As to claim 66, see the rejection of claim 54 and note that neither Takahashi nor
Murphy teach displaying direction to the location of a captured image. However, Bullock
teaches providing a map service that displays directions to the location of a captured
image (C2 L49-55 and C7 L66 to CS L14). Therefore it would have been obvious to one
of ordinary skill in the art at the time the invention was made to have provided the
device taught by Takahashi in view of Murphy to provide directions to the location of a
captured image as this would allow a user to navigate back to the location where a
picture was taken allowing them to easily find locations that they like but may not know

the way to.

25. Claim 69 is a method claim that is similar to the device of claim 66 and is rejected

on similar grounds.

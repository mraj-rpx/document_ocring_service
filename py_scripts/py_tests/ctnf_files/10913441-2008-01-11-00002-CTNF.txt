Art Unit: 2823

The following is a quotation of the appropriate paragraphs of 35 U.S.C. 102 that

form the basis for the rej ections under this section made in this Ofﬁce action:

A person shall be entitled to a patent unless —

(b) the invention was patented or described in a printed publication in this or a foreign country or in public
use or on sale in this country, more than one year prior to the date of application for patent in the United
States.

Claims 138 and 148 are rejected under 35 U.S.C. 102(b) as being anticipated by
Ogawa et al (US. Patent 5,437,894).

Ogawa et a1 discloses a bonding method, comprising ﬁrst and second materials
having ﬁrst and second bonding surfaces, respectively, enhancing activation and etching
said ﬁrst and second bonding surfaces, bringing into direct contact said ﬁrst and second
bonding surfaces after said etching step, terminating said ﬁrst and second bonding
surfaces with a species allowing formation of chemical bond, wherein forming at least
one of said ﬁrst and second bonding surfaces comprises depositing an insulating layer

(Column 2, lines 50-64, Column 9, lines 55-65, and Column 31, lines 53-67).

Claims 139—141, and 149-151, are rejected under 35 U.S.C. 103(a) as being
unpatentable over Ogawa et a] as applied to claims 138 and 148 above, and further in
view of the following comments.

Ogawa et 211 discloses the claimed invention except for forming a bond between
said ﬁrst and second bonding surfaces at room temperature with a strength of at least 500
mJ/mz, 1000 mJ/mz, and 2000 mJ/mz. It would have been obvious to one having ordinary
skill in the art at the time the invention was made to determine a suitable bond strength

between the ﬁrst and second bonding surfaces, since it has been held that where the

Applieation/Control Number: Page 3

Art Unit: 2823

general conditions of a claim are disclosed in the prior art, discovering the optimum or
workable ranges involves only routine skill in the art. In re Aller, 105 USPQ 233.

In addition, the selection of a suitable bond strength, it’s obvious because it is a
matter of determining optimum process conditions by routine experimentation with a
limited number of species of result effective variables. These claims are prima facie
obvious without showing that the claimed ranges achieve unexpected results relative to
the prior art range. In re Woodruff, 16 USPQ2d 1935, 1937 (Fed. Cir. 1990). See also In
re Huang, 40 USPQ2d 1685, 1688 (Fed. Cir. 1996)(claimed ranges or a result effective
variable, which do not overlap the prior art ranges, are unpatentable unless they produce a
new and unexpected result which is different in kind and not merely in degree from the
results of the prior art). See also In re Boesch, 205 USPQ 215 (CCPA) (discovery of
optimum value of result effective variable in known process is ordinarily within skill or
art) and In re Aller, 105 USPQ 233 (CCPA 1995) (selection Of optimum ranges within
prior art general conditions is obvious).

Note that the speciﬁcation contains no disclosure of either the critical nature of
the claimed bond strengths or any unexpected results arising therefrom. Where
patentability is said to be based upon particular chosen bond strengths or upon another
variable recited in a claim, the Applicant must show that the chosen bond strengths are

critical. In re Woodruz, 919 F.2d 1575, 1578, 16 USPQ2d 1934, 1936 (Fed. Cir. 1990).

Claims 145-147, and 153-157, and are objected to as being dependent upon a
‘ rejected base claim, but would be allowable if rewritten in independent form including all

of the limitations of the base claim andany intervening claims.

DETAILED ACTION
Drawings
1. New corrected drawings are required in this application because of Draftperson’s

Review. Applicant is advised to employ the services of a competent patent draftsperson
outside the Office, as the US. Patent and Trademark Office no longer prepares new
drawings. The corrected drawings are reqbired in reply to the Office action to avoid
abandonment of the application. The requirement for corrected drawings will not be held

in abeyance.

Claim Rejections - 35 USC § 702
2. The folIowing is a quotation of the appropriate paragraphs of 35 U.S.C. 102 that

form the basis for the rejections under this section made in this Office action:

A person shall be entitled to a patent unless —

(b) the invention was patented or described in a printed publication in this or a foreign country or in public
use or on sale in this country, more than one year prior to the date of application for patent in the United
States.

3. Claims 1, 3, 5, 6, 15-17, 39, and 40 are rejected under 35 U.S.C. 102(b) as being
anticipated by “InfoSIeuth: Agent-Based Semantic Integration of Information in Open
and Dynamic Environments” by BAYARDO et al.

As to claim 1, BAYARDO teaches a computer-implemented method for
communication and cooperative task completion between a community of distributed
electronic agents communicating using a dynamically expandable interagent-
communication language, ICL, (KQML) (pg. 197, Agent Communication Language) and

at least on other distributed component system (Resource Agent system), the other

Application/Control Number: 09/271 ,617 Page 3
Art Unit: 2126

distributed component system communicating using a protocol incompatible with the
ICL (pg. 199, Resource Agent, “The Resource Agent has to translate queries expressed
in a common query language (such as KQML/ KIF) into a language understood by the
underlying systerri.”), the method comprising the acts of: receiving by a bridge agent
(Resource Agent) a description of functional capabilities of components (information
source) of the other distributed component system from a component registry
(registered resources and their capabilities) of the other distributed component system
(pg. 197, “Resource Agent:...|t also advertises the resources capabilities.”); translating
the functional capabilities of components received from the protocol of the other
distributed component system into the ICL (KQML), to create a translated description
(pg. 197, Agent Interactions, “When a Resource Agent initializes, it sets up its
connection to its resources and advertises the components of ontology (ies) that it
understands to the Broker Agent”; pg. 199, Resource Agent, “The components of an
example Resource Agent...The language processor trans|ates a query expressed in
terms of global ontology into a query expressed in terms of the Oracle database
schema"); adding to a facilitator registry (registered agents and their capabilities) of the
community of distributed agents the translated description (pg. 199, “As agents come
online, they advertise their services to the broker via KQML...MinimaIIy, an agent must
advertise to the Broker its location, name, and the language it speak.”; pg. 197, “When a
Resource Agent initializes, it sets up its connection to its resource and advertises the
components of ontology (ies) that it understands to the Broker Agent”), wherein the

facilitator registry (registered agents and their capabilities with the Broker Agent) is

Application/Control Number: 09/271 ,617 Page 4
Art Unit: 2126

distinct from the component registry (registered resources and their capabilities with the
Resource Agent); responsive to a request (query) for service to the community of
distributed agents delegating an ICL sub-goal request (decomposed query) to the
bridge agent (Resource Agent) (pg. 197, “The Execution Agent takes the set of
appropriate Resource Agents, decomposes the query, and routes it appropriately.”) ;
translating at the bridge agent (Resource Agent) the delegated ICL sub-goal request
(decomposed query) into the incompatible protocol of the other distributed system to
create a translated request (pg. 197, “Each Resource Agent translates the query from
the query domain’s global ontology into the resource-specific schema..."); and invoking
one or more components of the other distributed component system using the
translated request (pg. 197, “...fetches the results and returns them to the Execution
Agent"; pg. 199, “The Resource Agent also needs to ariswer queries...the resource
agent sends them to the information source for execution, and translates the answers

back into the format understood by the requesting agent”).

As to claim 3, BAYARDO teaches the request for service is received from an
agent capable of communicating in the ICL (KQML) (pg. 197, UserAgent, “Currently,

the agents query the task execution agents using KQML with SQL content”).

As to claim 5, BAYARDO teaches the acts of: receiving functional capabilities of
a distributed electronic agent (resource agents); adding the functional capabilities to the

facilitator registry (registered agents and their capabilities with the Broker Agent) (pg.

 

Application/Control Number: 09/271 ,617 i Page 5
Art Unit: 2126

197, “When a Resource Agent initializes, it sets up its connection to its resource and
advertises the components of ontology (ies) that it understands to the Broker Agent”);
determining a second ICL sub-goal (decomposed query) necessary to accomplish the
request for service (query); selecting from the facilitator registry (registered agents and
their capabilities with the Broker Agent) an agent capable of completing the second ICL
sub-goal (via querying the Broker agent); and delegating the second ICL sub-goal
(decomposed query) to the selected agent (Resource Agent) (pg. 197, Agent
Interactions, “On receive a request...The Execution Agent reassembles the results and
returns them to the User Agent, which then returns the results to the user’s Viewer

applet for display.”).

As to claim 6, BAYARDO teaches the components are data objects and the
agents are written in Java (pg. 199-200, Implemention, Resource Agent,

Implementation). Therefore it is inherent that components are software-based objects.

As to claims 39, 15-17, reference is made to a computer readable medium that
corresponds to the method of claims 1, 3, 5, and 6 and is therefore met by the rejection

of claims 1, 3, 5 and 6 above.

As to claim 40, reference is made to a software computer architecture that
corresponds to the method of claim 1 and is therefore met by the rejection of claim 1

above.

Claim Rejections - 35 USC § 103
4. The following is a quotation of 35 U.S.C. 103(a) which forms the basis for all

obviousness rejections set forth in this Ofﬁce action:

(a) A patent may not be obtained though the invention is not identically disclosed or described as set
forth in section 102 of this title, if the differences between the subject matter sought to be patented and
the prior art are such that the subject matter as a whole would have been obvious at the time the
invention was made to a person having ordinary skill in the art to which said subject matter pertains.
Patentability shall not be negatived by the manner in which the invention was made.

5. Claims 2. 14, and 41 are rejected under 35 U.S.C. 103(a) as being unpatentable
over “InfoSIeuth: Agent-Based Semantic Integration of Information in Open and
Dynamic Environments” by BAYARDO et al. in view of “Information Brokering in an
Agent Architecture” by MARTIN et al.

As to claim 2, BAYARDO substantially discloses the invention above. However,
BAYARDO does not teach the request for service is generated by one of the
components.

MARTIN teaches the request for service is generated by one of the components
of the other distributed component system (information source), and comprising the acts
of: transmitting the request for service to the bridge agent (Broker); and translating the
request for service into the lCL (broker schema) (pg. 12, “The Broker also provides the
capability of answering queries that are expressed in the schema of the information
source, rather than the broker schema”; pg. 13, “But in addition, this legacy source may
also act as an information requestor, submitting queries that are formulated in terms of
its source schema. (A syntactic translation may be needed to place the query in lCL

syntax, but in most cases, this is relatively straightforward to implement"). Therefore, it

.\ .

Application/Control Number: 09/271 ,617 Page 7
Art Unit: 2126

would be obvious to combine the teachings of BAYARDO with the teachings of MARTIN
in order to facilitate transparent access in either a source or broker schema to a variety

of information sources (abstract).

As to claim 14, reference is made to a computer readable medium that
corresponds to the method of claim 2 and is therefore met by the rejection of claim 2

above.

As to claim 41, BAYARDO substantially discloses the invention above. However,
BAYARDO does not teach the bridge agent is integral with the facilitator.

MARTIN teaches the bridge agent is integral with the facilitator (pg. 7, figure 1).
Therefore, it would be obvious to combine the teachings of BAYARDO with the
teachings of MARTIN in order to work in close cooperation with another agent in an

agent architecture (pg. 6-7).

6. Claims 7-10, 18-21, and 25-28 are rejected under 35 U.S.C. 103(a) as being
unpatentable over “InfoSIeuth: Agent-Based Semantic Integration of Information in
Open and Dynamic Environments" by BAYARDO et at

As to claims 7-10, BAYARDO teaches the agents are objects and a user agent
communicates with data objects through a resource agent. However, BAYARDO does
not teach that the other distributed component system utilizes a distributed object

service or that service is Jini, Corba, or Java service. “Official Notice” is taken that JINI,

. .

Application/Control Number: 09/271 ,617 Page 8
Art Unit: 2126

CORBA, and Java are well-known object oriented software services for communication
between objects. Therefore, it would be obvious to one of ordinary skill in the art at the
time of the invention to combine the teachings of BAYARDO with the well known
distributed object services in order to communicate with between a variety of objects

that implement different object services.

As to claims 18-21, reference is made to a computer readable medium that
corresponds to the method of claims 7-10 and is therefore met by the rejection of claims

7-10 above.

As to claims 25-28, reference is made to a software computer architecture that
corresponds to the method of claims 7-10 and is therefore met by the rejection of claims

7-10 above.

Response to Arguments
7. Applicant's arguments with respect to claims 1-3, 5-10, 14-21, 25-28, and 39-41

have been considered but are moot in view of the new ground(s) of rejection.

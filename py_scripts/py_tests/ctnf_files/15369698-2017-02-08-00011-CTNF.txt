DETAILED ACTION

Claim Rejections — 35 USCSY 102
1. The following is a quotation of the appropriate paragraphs of 35 U.S.C. 102 that form the

basis for the rejections under this section made in this Ofﬁce action:

A person shaﬂ be entitled to a patent unless —

(e) the invention was described in (1) an apphcation for patent, puinshed under section 122(b), by another ﬁled in
the United States before the invention by the apphcant for patent or (2) a patent granted on an application for patent
by another ﬁled in the United States before the invention by the apphcant for patent, except that an international
apphcation ﬁled under the treaty deﬁned in section 351 (a) shaﬂ have the effects for purposes of this subsection of an
apphcation ﬁled in the United States only if the international apphcation designated the United States and was
puinshed under Article 21 (2) of such treaty in the EngJish language.

2. Claims 1—21 are rejected under 35 U.S.C. 102(e) as being anticipated by Simon et aL, US.
Patent No. 7,039,222.

Regarding claim 1, Simon discloses a method of processing a digital image using face
detection to achieve one or more desired image processing parameters (col. 3, lines 9—28),
comprising:

identifying a group of pixels that correspond to a face image Within the digital image (col. 3,
lines 9—15 — detecting a face by the system requires identifying the pixels that corresponds to a face
in the image);

detecting a skin tone for the face image by determining one or more default color or tonal
values, or combinations thereof, for the group of pixels (col. 3, lines 18—22 — based on the facially
relevant characteristics of the different regions, selecting one or more enhancement ﬁlters each
customized especially for a particular region; col. 25, lines 1 through col. 26, line 21 — the

characteristic being skin tone); and

Application/Control Number: 15/369,698 Page 3
Art Unit: 2666

adjusting values of one or more parameters for the group of pixels that correspond to the
face image based on the detected skin tone (col. 3, lines 22—24; col. 24, lines 59—62; col. 25, lines 1—

65).

Regarding claim 2, Simon discloses Wherein the adjusting comprises applying ﬁll—ﬂash to the

face image in an amount based on the skin tone (col. 25, lines 40—65 — adding light to the face).

Regarding claim 3, Simon discloses the method of claim 1, further comprising repeating the
identifying, detecting and adjusting for a second face image having a different skin tone than the ﬁrst
face image, and the adjusting comprises applying ﬁJl—ﬂash to the two face images in different relative
amounts depending on the different skin tones (col. 8, lines 62—65 — for more than one face in the
image, the system iterates the enhancement steps used for the ﬁrst face; Where the enhancement is
performed adaptively depending on the skin tone (col. 25, lines 1—65) and apparently every face has a

different skin tone).

Regarding claim 4, Simon discloses the method of claim 1, Wherein the adjusting comprises

adjusting a luminance of the face image depending on the skin tone (col. 24, lines 59—62; col. 25,

lines 1—65).

Regarding claim 5, claim 5 has been similarly analyzed and rejected as per the claims 3 and 4.

Regarding claim 6, Simon discloses Wherein the color or tonal values for the group of pixels

comprise one or more average color or tonal values (col. 25,1ines 15—57).

Application/Control Number: 15/369,698 Page 4
Art Unit: 2666

Regarding claim 7, Simon discloses the method of claim 6, Wherein the color or tonal values

comprise multiple colors or tones, or combinations thereof, determined for each of multiple regions

of the face image (col. 25, line 48 — variance of the color distribution of a region).

Claims 8 and 15 have been similarly analyzed and rejected as per claim 1.

Claims 9 and 16 have been similarly analyzed and rejected as per claim 2.

Claims 10 and 17 have been similarly analyzed and rejected as per claim 3.

Claims 11 and 18 have been similarly analyzed and rejected as per claim 4.

Claims 12 and 19 have been similarly analyzed and rejected as per claim 5.

Claims 13 and 20 have been similarly analyzed and rejected as per claim 6.

Claim 14 has been similarly analyzed and rejected as per claim 7.

3. Claims 1—2, 8—9 and 15—16 are rejected under 35 U.S.C. 102(e) as being anticipated by Lin,

U.S. Patent Publication No. 2003/0235333A1.

Application/Control Number: 15/369,698 Page 5
Art Unit: 2666

Regarding claims 1, 8 and 15, Lin discloses a method of processing a digital image using face
detection to achieve one or more desired image processing parameters (para 0006), comprising:

identifying a group of pixels that correspond to a face image Within the digital image (para
0006 — detecting a face by the system requires identifying the pixels that corresponds to a face in the
image);

detecting a skin tone for the face image by determining one or more default color or tonal
values, or combinations thereof, for the group of pixels (para 0006 — skin tone is extracted for the
detected face — Where skin tone values are the value of the color variance); and

adjusting values of one or more parameters for the group of pixels that correspond to the
face image based on the detected skin tone (para 0006 — a balance parameter is generated based on

the extracted skin tone; in this case the balance parameter being the White balance — para 0026; para

0034).

Regarding claims 2, 9 and 16, Simon discloses Wherein the adjusting comprises applying ﬁll—
ﬂash to the face image in an amount based on the skin tone (para 0026 — adding light to the

face/White balance).

Double Pa tenting

4. The nonstatutory double patenting rejection is based on a judicially created doctrine
grounded in public policy (a policy reﬂected in the statute) so as to prevent the unjustiﬁed or
improper timewise extension of the “right to exclude” granted by a patent and to prevent possible
harassment by multiple assignees. A nonstatutory double patenting rejection is appropriate Where
the conﬂicting claims are not identical, but at least one examined application claim is not patentably
distinct from the reference claim(s) because the examined application claim is either anticipated by,
or would have been obvious over, the reference claim(s). See, e.g., In re Berg, 140 F.3d 1428, 46
USPQ2d 1226 (Fed. Cir. 1998); In re Good/nnn, 11 F.3d 1046, 29 USPQ2d 2010 (Fed. Cir. 1993); In re
Longz, 759 F.2d 887, 225 USPQ 645 (Fed. Cir. 1985); In re Vnn 07mm, 686 F.2d 937, 214 USPQ 761
(CCPA 1982); In re Vogel, 422 F.2d 438, 164 USPQ 619 (CCPA 1970); In re T/aon'ngz‘on, 418 F.2d 528,
163 USPQ 644 (CCPA 1969).

A timely ﬁled terminal disclaimer in compliance With 37 CFR 1.321(c) or 1.321(d) may be
used to overcome an actual or provisional rejection based on nonstatutory double patenting
provided the reference application or patent either is shown to be commonly owned With the
examined application, or claims an invention made as a result of activities undertaken Within the
scope of a joint research agreement. See MPEP S 717.02 for applications subject to examination
under the ﬁrst inventor to file provisions of the AIA as explained in MPEP § 2159. See MPEP §§
706.02(1) (1) — 706.02(1)(3) for applications not subject to examination under the ﬁrst inventor to file
provisions of the AIA. A terminal disclaimer must be signed in compliance With 37 CFR 1.321 (b).

The USPTO Internet website contains terminal disclaimer forms Which may be used. Please
Visit WWW.uspto.gov/patent/patents—forms. The filing date of the application in Which the form is

ﬁled determines What form (e.g., PTO/SB/25, PTO/SB/26, PTO/AIA/25, or PTO/AIA/26)

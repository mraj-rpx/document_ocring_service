DETAILED ACTION
Claim Rejections - 35 USC § 103
1. The following is a quotation of 35 U.S.'C. 103(a) which forms the basis for all
obviousness rejections set forth in this Office action:

(a) A patent may not be obtained though the invention is not identically disclosed or described as set

forth in section 102 of this title, if the differences between the subject matter sought to be patented and
the prior art are such that the subject matter as a whole would have been obvious at the time the
invention was made to a person having ordinary skill in the art to which said subject matter pertains.

Patentability shall not be negatived by the manner in which the invention was made.

1. Claims 1- 27 are rejected under 35 U.S.C. 103(a) as being unpatentable over
Purcell (US 2001/0013038 A1) in view of Hughes et al. (hereinafter “Hughes”, US
2003/0195876 A1_).

As per claims 1, 19-24, Purcell discloses a system and user interface mechanism for
session based retrieval and at a client system of content from a server system, said
server system serving a string based content, said string based content including a
plurality of strings, comprising:

a communication protocol that provides a session based connection between
a client system and a server system, and allows said client system to query said server
system for content (paragraphs [0011], [0019], [0028]);

a client object, in communication with a client software at said client system,
said client object capable of transmitting to a server object a plurality of queries to

retrieve content from said content engine, wherein each of said plurality of queries

Application/Control Number:~ 09/933,493 , Page 3
Art Unit: 2157

comprises a single string character, and wherein each subsequent of said plurality of»
queriesextend the query (paragraphs [0029]-[0030], [0034]-[0035]);
a server object, in communication with a server software at saidiserver system,
said server object furthermore in communication with said client object via said
communlication protocol and in response to each of said queries returns increasingly
appropriate content information to the client object as the query is being extended
(paragraphs [0022], [0024], [0030], [0034]—[0036]).
‘Purcell does not explicitly disclose:
server object records each of said plurality of queries.
However, in an analogous art, Hughes discloses a server database that stores query
records (paragraphs [00121-[0013], [0030], [0039], [0049])
Therefore, one of ordinary skill in the art at the time the invention was made would have
found it obvious to implement or incorporate tecording queries in Purcell’s system in

order for the user to have access to past queries made.

As per claim 2, Purcell discloses the system of claim 1 wherein said client
software operates on or at a first computer and said server software operates on or at a
second computer, and wherein both of said ﬁrst and said second computers are
connected via a communication network protocol (paragraphs [00181-[0019], [0022],

[0024]).

Application/Control Number: 09/933,493 , Page 4
Art Unit: 2157

As per claim 3, Purcell discloses the system of claim 1 wherein said server software

and said client software runs on the same computer (paragraph [0024]).

As per claim 4, Purcell discloses the system of claim 1 wherein said server software
runs on a plurality of separate computers, and wherein said client queries are

distributed over said separate servers (paragraph [0029]-[0030]). "

As per claim 5, Purcell discloses the system of claim 1.

Purcell does not explicitly discloses:
wherein said server software stores previously used strings and returns said

stored strings to the client in response to new client queries, without accessing said
content engine.
However, in an analogous art, Hughes discloses a server database that stores query
records (paragraphs [0012]-[0013], [0030], [0039], [0049])
Therefore, one of ordinary skill in the art at the time the invention was made would have
found it obvious to implement or incorporate storing previously used strings in Purcell’s

system in order for the-user to have access to past queries made.

As per claims 6 and 25, Purcell further discloses the system and mechanism of
claims 1 and 24 wherein said client software is embedded into a software application

that provides a visual'interface to an operator (paragraphs [0018], [0036]).

Application/Control Number: 09/933,493 - Page 5
Art Unit: 2157

As per claim 7, Purcell discloses the system of claim 1 wherein said client software is
used as a content engine for another software system (paragraphs [0029]—[0030],

[0034}{0035».

As per claim 8, Purcell discloses the system of claim 1 wherein said client software
accumulates a plurality of said single character queries as they are entered into the
client, before sending them together to said server software as a string (paragraph

[0034D.

As per claims 9 and 10, Purcell discloses the system of claim 1 wherein said client
software stores previously received responses and uses these as the response to a

new query by the user, without reassessing the server (paragraphs [0036]-[0037]).

As per claims 11 and 13, Purcelt discloses the system of claim 1.
Purcell does not explicitly disclose wherein said server software stores the state of
query and response of the client software, and restores the state of the client software
after any interruption in said communication protocol.
However, in an analogous art, Hughes discloses a server database that stores query
records (paragraphs [0012]-[0013], [0030], [0039], [0049]).
Therefore, one of ordinary skill in the art at the time the invention was made would have
found it obvious to implement or incorporate storing queries and responses in Purcell’s

system in order for the user to have access to past queries made

Application/Control Number: 09/933,493 Page 6
Art Unit: 2157 A

As per claim 12, Purcell discloses the system of claim 1 where said client software
adds a qualifier to the query that is passed to the content engine by the server, whereby
the content engine can use said qualiﬁer to execute the query and return appropriate

results based on both the query string and its qualifier (paragraphs[00381-[0039]).

As per claim 14, Purcell discloses the system of claim 1 where said server software
is distributed within a server tier and a syndication tier, and wherein said client software
communicates to the server tier on a single computer, and wherein each query is
forwarded by the server tier to an appropriate syndicate of content channels connected

to the server tier on a different computer (paragraph [0029]).

As per claim 15, Purcell discloses the system of claim 1 where said server software
applies a content engine dependent pattern and ﬁlter to characters received from the

client-before queries are transmitted to the Content engine (paragraph [OO41]).

As per claim 16, Purcell discloses the system of claim 15 wherein the number of

queries transmitted to the content engine is limited (paragraph [OO36]).

As per claims 17-18, Purcell further discloses the system of claim 1 where server

responses comprise lists of strings, wherein each string is accompanied by

Application/Control Number: 09/933,493 Page 7
Art Unit: 2157

corresponding metadata, whereby the metadata contains logical links to other data

sources or Uniform Resource Identiﬁers (paragraph [0029]).

As per claim 25, Purcell discloses the mechanism of claim 24, wherein said user

interface element is an application input field.

As per claims 26-27, Purcell discloses the mechanism of claim 24, wherein said
session indicator displays a triangular display element to indicate the presence of said
session, and does not display said triangular display element to indicate the absence of

said session (paragraphs [0034]-[0036]).

Conclusion
2. The prior art made of record and not relied upon is considered pertinent to
applicant's disclosure.

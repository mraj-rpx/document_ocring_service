Application/Control Number: 11/403,548 Page 2
Art Unit: 2437

Remarks
Claims 1-18 are pending.
Specification
1. The attempt to incorporate subject matter into this application by reference to

Attorney Docket No. 69936-P001US-1061228 is ineffective because the reference to
this application does not include an official application, publication, or patent number. In
paragraphs 1 and 35 of the specification, reference is made to "US. Patent Application
No. XX/XXX,XXX". In order to be a proper incorporation by reference, the appropriate
application number may be filled in or the patent number (if patented) may be used, for

example.

Claim Objections
2. Claim 17 is objected to because of the following informalities: Claim 17,
dependent from claim 14, refers to "said establishing a third communication request",
however, no such establishment of such a request has been set forth in claim 14 or 17
until this point. For purposes of prior art rejection, this has been construed as “said

establishing a third communication connection”. Appropriate correction is required.

Claim Rejections - 35 USC § 112

The following is a quotation of the second paragraph of 35 U.S.C. 112:

The specification shall conclude with one or more claims particularly pointing out and distinctly
claiming the subject matter which the applicant regards as his invention.

Application/Control Number: 11/403,548 Page 3
Art Unit: 2437

3. Claims 14-18 are rejected under 35 U.S.C. 112, second paragraph, as being
indefinite for failing to particularly point out and distinctly claim the subject matter which
applicant regards as the invention.

The first 2 limitations of claim 14 appear to occur in the alternative. This is noted
by limitation 3, stating “responsive to one or more of the first and second communication

request...’. It is unclear what limitations are actually part of the claim, which limitations
always occur, and which may only occur in certain circumstances. The Examiner has
taken the first 2 limitations in the alternative, such that only 1 need be performed to lead
into limitation 3. As is clear from the third limitation, only a single one of the first 2
limitations must be completed before the third limitation can occur. If Applicant intends
for both of the first two limitations to occur, it must be made clear and, likewise, if
Applicant intends for only a single one of the first two limitations to occur, it must be
made clear.

Furthermore, the first limitation of claim 14 recites "establishing a first
communication connection between a first internaI controIIer behind a firewall and a first
external controller in a first communication community”. It is unclear what the external
controller is external from. It cannot be both external (based on the name external
controller) and internal ("a first external controIIerin a first communication community")
to the community. It cannot be external to the firewall, as, based on the claimed
limitations, the firewall appears to separate and form this community (the community

being behind the firewall). At best, this first external controller can be external to the

first internaI controIIer, however, this appears inherent in the claim since the first internaI

Application/Control Number: 11/403,548 Page 4
Art Unit: 2437

controller is connected to both the local communication device and the first external
controller. This is how this first external controller has been construed, such that the
first internaI controller is between the local communication device and the first external
controller. This appears to be the only logical conclusion that can be made regarding
an external controIIer within a community including a firewall. The second limitation of
claim 14 provides a like description of the second external controller, and has been
construed in the same fashion.

Claim 15 discusses verifying the first communication request in the first limitation
and verifying the second communication request in the second limitation, however,
there is no "and" or "or" in between these limitations to show that both must be part of
the claim or only 1. As discussed above, this has been taken in the alternative. Claim
18 has the same issue with limitations not being joined with "and" or "or" such that it is
unclear if both limitations need be performed or only one of them. The Examiner has
performed a prior art search for and has rejected claims 14-18 as they can best be

understood.

Claim Rejections - 35 USC § 101

35 U.S.C. 101 reads as follows:

Whoever invents or discovers any new and useful process, machine, manufacture, or composition of
matter, or any new and useful improvement thereof, may obtain a patent therefor, subject to the
conditions and requirements of this title.

4. Claims 9-13 are rejected under 35 U.S.C. 101 because the claimed invention is

directed to non-statutory subject matter.

Application/Control Number: 11/403,548 Page 5
Art Unit: 2437

Claim 9 is directed to “A communication community comprising:” one or more
shared controllers, at least one individual controller, and an external controller.
However, none of these controllers are defined in the application as being physical
entities (e.g. devices), logical entities (e.g. program code), or anything at all. Therefore,
these controllers are as broad as to be any entity that can perform the functions of said
controllers. As one can see, these controllers may be hardware, software, or a
combination thereof. Therefore, claim 9 fails to fall in one of the statutory categories of
invention, since it is not a process, apparatus, article of manufacture, or composition of
matter. None of claims 10-13 fix this issue, therefore, claims 10-13 are rejected for the

same reasons.

Claim Rejections - 35 USC § 102
The following is a quotation of the appropriate paragraphs of 35 U.S.C. 102 that

form the basis for the rejections under this section made in this Office action:

A person shall be entitled to a patent unless —

(e) the invention was described in (1) an application for patent, published under section 122(b), by
another filed in the United States before the invention by the applicant for patent or (2) a patent
granted on an application for patent by another filed in the United States before the invention by the
applicant for patent, except that an international application filed under the treaty defined in section
351 (a) shall have the effects for purposes of this subsection of an application filed in the United States
only if the international application designated the United States and was published under Article 21 (2)
of such treaty in the English language.

5. Claims 14-16 are rejected under 35 U.S.C. 102(e) as being anticipated by Alt
(US. Patent Application Publication 2007/0036143).
Regarding Claim 14,

Alt discloses a method for communicating comprising:

Application/Control Number: 11/403,548 Page 6
Art Unit: 2437

Establishing a first communication connection between a first
internal controller behind a firewall and a first external controller in a first
communication community, wherein a first communication request is
initiated by a local communication device connected to the first internal
controller (Figures 2 and 6; and Paragraphs 48, 57, and 95-97; as
described above, there is a discrepancy between external and the external
controller being in the community, therefore, any of SIP proxy servers
207e, 209e, and 611 may be construed as the external controllers here, in
addition to the external controllers described below with respect to claim
1);

Establishing a second communication connection between a
second internal controller behind a second firewall and a second external
controller in a second communication community, wherein a second
communication request is initiated by a remote communication device
connected to the second internal controller (Figures 2 and 6; and
Paragraphs 48, 57, 58, and 95-100; as discussed here, use of soft phone
207d as the originating endpoint and soft phone 209d as the terminating
endpoint is merely illustrative, and each soft phone in the system is able to
both originate and terminate connections/calls in the SIP system);

Responsive to one or more of the first and second communication
request requesting communication between the local communication

device and the remote communication device, establishing a third

Application/Control Number: 11/403,548 Page 7
Art Unit: 2437

communication connection between the first and second external
communication controllers (Figure 4; and Paragraphs 95-100;); and

Transmitting communication data between the first and second
communication communities through the third communication connection
(Paragraphs 95-100; steps 417, 423, 429, and 435, for example,
constituting transmitting communication data between the proxies, each in
one of the communities. Other interpretations are, of course, possible, as
described below with respect to the external controllers).

Regarding Claim 15,

Alt discloses verifying at the first external controller the first
communication request prior to establishing the first communication
connection (Figure 4; and Paragraphs 95-97, step 405, for example);

Verifying at the second external controller the second
communication request prior to establishing the second communication
connection (Figures 2, 4, and 6; and Paragraphs 48, 57, 58, and 95-100;
as described above, either phone can initiate communications and, in the
case that the second endpoint initiates communication, step 405 will be
performed between the second endpoint and the second controller).

Regarding Claim 16,

Alt discloses issuing a third communication request between the

first and second external communication controllers (Figure 4; and

Paragraphs 95-100; such request comprising, for example, step 413); and

Application/Control Number: 11/403,548 Page 8
Art Unit: 2437

Verifying the third communication request prior to establishing the
third communication connection (Figure 4; and Paragraphs 95-100;
verification comprising, for example, the DNS lookup and response in step

415).

Claim Rejections - 35 USC § 103
The following is a quotation of 35 U.S.C. 103(a) which forms the basis for all

obviousness rejections set forth in this Office action:

(a) A patent may not be obtained though the invention is not identically disclosed or described as set
forth in section 102 of this title, if the differences between the subject matter sought to be patented and
the prior art are such that the subject matter as a whole would have been obvious at the time the
invention was made to a person having ordinary skill in the art to which said subject matter pertains.
Patentability shall not be negatived by the manner in which the invention was made.

6. Claims 17 and 18 are rejected under 35 U.S.C. 103(a) as being unpatentable
over AIt in view of Strathmeyer (US. Patent Application Publication 2005/0122964).
Regarding Claim 17,
Alt discloses that establishing the third communication connection
comprises:
Issuing a third communication request to a central communication
controller (Figure 4; and Paragraphs 95-100, step 413, for example);
Establishing a first central communication channel between the first
external communication controller and the central communication
controller (Figure 4; and Paragraphs 95-100, steps 413 and 415, for
example, showing a communication channel between the ENUM server

and SIP proxy 1; the ENUM server could be the central communication

Application/Control Number: 11/403,548 Page 9
Art Unit: 2437

controller, or any entity in (or the entirety of) the service provider network
may correspond to the central controller);

But does not explicitly disclose issuing a fourth communication
request from the central communication controller to the second external
communication controller, and establishing a second central
communication channel between the central communication controller and
the second external controller.

Strathmeyer, however, discloses issuing a fourth communication
request from the central communication controller to the second external
communication controller; and establishing a second central
communication channel between the central communication controller and
the second external controller (Figures 6 and 7; and Paragraphs 52, 61,
63-65, and 74; as can be seen, all communications go through all entities,
therefore, in figure 6, for example, the outbound proxy could correspond to
the first external controller, while entity 602 may correspond to the central
controller. In figure 7, the proxy server corresponds to the first external
controller and the server 505 corresponds to the central controller, which
also connects to the SIP proxy 209e in the combination). It would have
been obvious to one of ordinary skill in the art at the time of applicant’s
invention to incorporate the IP telephony system of Strathmeyer into the
communication system of AIt as modified by Aasman in order to allow the

system to provide call control and monitoring in a way that does not affect

Application/Control Number: 11/403,548 Page 10
Art Unit: 2437

the operation of current proxy servers and such that the control and
monitoring system has full access to all caII data, thereby ensuring that all
caII data is available for monitoring and control and that the
monitoring/control system makes fuIIy-informed decisions and logs of the
call data.

Regarding Claim 18,

Alt discloses verifying the third communication request at the
central communication controller prior to establishing the first central
communication channel (Figure 4; and Paragraphs 95-100); and

Strathmeyer discloses verifying the fourth communication request
prior to establishing the second central communication channel (Figures 6
and 7; and Paragraphs 52, 61, 63-65, and 74; such verification could be
merely a response provided back through the communication links, for

example).

7. Claims 1-5 and 9-13 are rejected under 35 U.S.C. 103(a) as being unpatentable
overAIt in view of Aasman (US. Patent Application Publication 2003/0065737).
Regarding Claim 1,
Alt discloses a method for a multimedia communication comprising:
Receiving at an external controller a communication request from a
controller behind a firewall, wherein the controller is connected to a

plurality of communication endpoints (Figure 2; and Paragraphs 48, 57,

Application/Control Number: 11/403,548 Page 11
Art Unit: 2437

and 95-97; the controller could be, for example, the NAT or internal SIP
proxy server, both of which send requests to entities in the service
provider network, such as the STUN, ENUM, and TURN, any and/or all of
which (e.g. any single entity or the entirety of the service provider network)
can correspond to the external controller. It is noted here that the word
"controller" in the claim does not appear to mean anything other than that
the controller is some entity (e.g. a device, a program, a portion of a
device). This is how controller has been construed, so long as the cited
controIIer performs the claimed functionality.);

Establishing a communication channel between the controller and
the external controller (Figure 3; and Paragraphs 48, 57, and 95-97; steps
401, 403, and 413-415 correspond to such establishment of
communication between the controllers discussed above);

Opening a second communication channel between the external
controller and at least one other controIIer behind another firewall
(Paragraphs 97-100; communication with endpoint 209d being performed
via the TURN server, for example);

Transmitting multimedia communication data between the controller
and the at least one other controller wherein the multimedia
communication data passes through the external controller (Figure 4; and
Paragraphs 100-101; the endpoints exchanging media via the TURN

server; this traffic will go through the firewaIIs on each side and the NAT

Application/Control Number: 11/403,548 Page 12
Art Unit: 2437

devices on each side, as one can see from the communication links of
figure 2 and the description of firewalls and NAT devices (paragraphs 39-
40, for example)); and

Distributing the multimedia communication data to one or more of
the plurality of communication endpoints and another communication
endpoint (Figure 4; and Paragraphs 44 and 100-101);

But does not explicitly disclose that the at least one other controller
is configured to service a single communication endpoint.

Aasman, however, discloses that the at least one other controller is
configured to service a single communication endpoint (Figure 1; and
Paragraphs 64, 72-73, and 80-81; personal proxy 9, for example,
corresponding to a controller servicing a single endpoint). It would have
been obvious to one of ordinary skill in the art at the time of applicant’s
invention to incorporate the proxy techniques of Aasman into the
communication system of AIt in order to allow for various user editable
filters to be used in proxies separate from and/or within the endpoints,
such filters allowing for the modification of data to be perceived by the
user, such that extraneous data can be removed and display of data can
be modified to meet screen resolutions/Iimitations.

Regarding Claim 2,
Alt as modified by Aasman discloses the method of claim 1, in

addition, AIt discloses verifying the communication request at the external

Application/Control Number: 11/403,548 Page 13
Art Unit: 2437

controller (Paragraphs 68-72; authentication via certificates, private keys,
and/or shared secrets, for example, being performed by entities in the
service provider network).

Regarding Claim 3,

Alt as modified by Aasman discloses the method of claim 1, in
addition, AIt discloses transmitting a security key from the controller to the
external controller for authorization of the communication request
(Paragraphs 68-72).

Regarding Claim 4,

Alt as modified by Aasman discloses the method of claim 1, in
addition, Alt discloses sending an external request from the external
controller to an additional external controller responsive to communication
requesting to communicate with an additional endpoint connected to the
additional external controller (Figure 2; and Paragraphs 59 and 101-110;
in the scenario of figure 5 (paragraphs 101 -105), gateway 215
corresponds to the additional external controller, and an entity on the
PSTN network corresponds to the additional endpoint, such as the cell
phone 217 or POTS phone 219, for example. In the scenario of figure 6a
(paragraphs 106-110), SIP proxy server 611 may be seen as the
additional external controller, while endpoints 605, 607, or 609 could be
the additional endpoint, for example).

Regarding Claim 5,

Application/Control Number: 11/403,548 Page 14
Art Unit: 2437

Alt as modified by Aasman discloses the method of claim 4, in
addition, Alt discloses establishing an external channel between the
external controller and the additional external controller; forwarding the
multimedia communication data to the additional external controller from
the external controller; and distributing the multimedia communication data
to the additional endpoint (Figure 2; and Paragraphs 59 and 101-110).

Regarding Claim 9,

Alt discloses a communication community comprising:

One or more shared controllers connected to one or more
communication endpoints, wherein the one or more shared controllers is
behind a firewall (Figure 2; and Paragraphs 48, 57, and 95-97);

At least one other controller connected to a communication
endpoint, wherein the at least one other controller is behind another
firewall (Paragraphs 97-100); and

An external controller in connection to the one or more shared
controllers and the at least one other controller, wherein the external
controller facilitates communication between ones of the one or more
communication endpoints and the single communication endpoint (Figure
4; and Paragraphs 100-101);

But does not explicitly disclose that the at least one other controller

is an individual controller connected to a single communication endpoint.

Application/Control Number: 11/403,548 Page 15
Art Unit: 2437

Aasman, however, discloses that the at least one other controller is
an individual controller connected to a single communication endpoint
(Figure 1; and Paragraphs 64, 72-73, and 80-81; personal proxy 9, for
example, corresponding to a controller servicing a single endpoint). It
would have been obvious to one of ordinary skill in the art at the time of
applicant’s invention to incorporate the proxy techniques of Aasman into
the communication system of AIt in order to allow for various user editable
filters to be used in proxies separate from and/or within the endpoints,
such filters allowing for the modification of data to be perceived by the
user, such that extraneous data can be removed and display of data can
be modified to meet screen resolutions/Iimitations.

Regarding Claim 10,

Alt as modified by Aasman discloses the community of claim 9, in
addition, AIt discloses a verification utility within the external controller for
verifying one or more communication requests from one or more of the
one or more shared controllers and the individual controller (Paragraphs
68-72 and 82-83).

Regarding Claim 11,

Alt as modified by Aasman discloses the community of claim 9, in
addition, Alt discloses a security key repository within each of the one or
more shared controllers and the individual controller, wherein the one or

more shared controllers and the individual controller transmit a security

Application/Control Number: 11/403,548 Page 16
Art Unit: 2437

key for verification by the external controller for each communication
request issued to the external controller (Paragraphs 68-72 and 82-83;
when a certificate is allocated per island and stored on the respective
island, this certificate will be stored on a controller of the island (island
being defined as a closed community of IP-enabled users in paragraph 4
of Alt). If an endpoint also has a specific key or certificate, it will be also
be temporarily stored in some fashion in the controller and transmitted
with requests).
Regarding Claim 12,
Alt as modified by Aasman discloses the community of claim 9, in
addition, Alt discloses an external interface within the external controller
for communicating with a second communication community (Figure 2).
Regarding Claim 13,
Alt as modified by Aasman discloses the community of claim 12, in
addition, AIt discloses that the external controller communicates with a
central communication controller to establish a communication channel
with the second communication community (Paragraphs 97-105; showing

DNS Iookups to an ENUM server, for example).

8. Claims 6-8 are rejected under 35 U.S.C. 103(a) as being unpatentable over AIt in
view of Aasman and Strathmeyer.

Regarding Claim 6,

Application/Control Number: 11/403,548 Page 17
Art Unit: 2437

Alt as modified by Aasman discloses the method of claim 1, in
addition, Alt discloses a communication request requesting to
communicate with an external endpoint not connected to one or more of
the controller and the at least one other controIIer (Figure 2; and
Paragraphs 59 and 101-110); but does not explicitly disclose issuing a
central request from the external controller to a central controIIer
responsive to the communication request requesting to communicate with
an external endpoint not connected to one or more of the controller and
the at least one other controller; and receiving the multimedia
communication data at the central controller.

Strathmeyer, however, discloses issuing a central request from the
external controller to a central controIIer responsive to a communication
request requesting to communicate with an external endpoint not
connected to one or more of the controller and the at least one other
controller; and receiving the multimedia communication data at the central
controller (Figures 6 and 7; and Paragraphs 52, 61, 63-65, and 74; in this
situation, the elements described above as the external controller may be
construed as the central controller, and the external controller will
comprise the passthrough server, the proxy server, and/or the server in
figure 7, for example; or the outbound proxy of figure 6, for example). It
would have been obvious to one of ordinary skill in the art at the time of

applicant’s invention to incorporate the IP telephony system of

Application/Control Number: 11/403,548 Page 18
Art Unit: 2437

Strathmeyer into the communication system of AIt as modified by Aasman
in order to allow the system to provide call control and monitoring in a way
that does not affect the operation of current proxy servers and such that
the control and monitoring system has full access to all caII data, thereby
ensuring that all caII data is available for monitoring and control and that
the monitoring/control system makes fuIIy-informed decisions and logs of
the call data.

Regarding Claim 7,

Alt as modified by Aasman and Strathmeyer discloses the method
of claim 6, in addition, AIt discloses determining a peripheral controller
connected to the external endpoint; opening another external channel
between the central controller and the peripheral controller; forwarding the
multimedia communication data to the peripheral controller from the
central controller; and distributing the multimedia communication data to
the external endpoint (Figure 2; and Paragraphs 59 and 101-110; as
discussed above, in the combination, entities in the service provider
network may be construed as the central controller; and as discussed with
respect to claims 4 and 5 above, the gateway may be the peripheral
controller in this claim).

Regarding Claim 8,
Alt as modified by Aasman and Strathmeyer discloses the method

of claim 6, in addition, AIt discloses distributing the multimedia

Application/Control Number: 11/403,548 Page 19
Art Unit: 2437

communication data to the external endpoint when the external endpoint is
connected to the central controller (Figure 2; and Paragraphs 59 and 101-

110).

Conclusion

Any inquiry concerning this communication or earlier communications from the
examiner should be directed to JEFFREY D. POPHAM whose telephone number is
